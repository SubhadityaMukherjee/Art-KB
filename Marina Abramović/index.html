In 2007, she founded the Marina Abramović Institute (MAI), a non-profit foundation for <a href=Performance%20Art.md>performance art</a>.</li> <li>Abramović was raised by her grandparents until she was six years old. Her grandmother was deeply religious and Abramović &ldquo;spent childhood in a church following grandmother&rsquo;s rituals—candles in the morning, the priest coming for different occasions&rdquo;. When she was six, her brother was born, and she began living with her parents while also taking piano, French, and English lessons. Although she did not take art lessons, she took an early interest in art and enjoyed painting as a child.</li> <li>Life in Abramović&rsquo;s parental home under her mother&rsquo;s strict supervision was difficult. When Abramović was a child, her mother beat her for &ldquo;supposedly showing off&rdquo;. In an interview published in 1998, Abramović described how her &ldquo;mother took complete military-style control of me and my brother. I was not allowed to leave the house after 10 o&rsquo;clock at night until I was 29 years old. &hellip; ll the performances in Yugoslavia I did before 10 o&rsquo;clock in the evening because I had to be home then. It&rsquo;s completely insane, but all of my cutting myself, whipping myself, burning myself, almost losing my life in &lsquo;The Firestar&rsquo;—everything was done before 10 in the evening.&rdquo;</li> <li>In an interview published in 2013, Abramović said, &ldquo;My mother and father had a terrible marriage.&rdquo; Describing an incident when her father smashed 12 champagne glasses and left the house, she said, &ldquo;It was the most horrible moment of my childhood.&rdquo;</li> <li><a href=../Rhythm%20Series/ >Rhythm Series</a></li> <li><a href=../The%20Artist%20is%20present/ >The Artist is present</a></li> </ul> <br> <div class="row wm-article-nav-buttons" role=navigation aria-label=navigation> <div class="wm-article-nav pull-right"> <a href=../Matelegu%20Ferendam/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-right"> Next <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden=true></i> </a> <a href=../Matelegu%20Ferendam/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Matelegu Ferendam </a> </div> <div class=wm-article-nav> <a href=../Maria/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-left"> <i class="fa fa-chevron-left" aria-hidden=true></i> Previous</a><a href=../Maria/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Maria </a> </div> </div> <br> </div> <footer class="container-fluid wm-page-content"> <p>Documentation built with <a href=https://www.mkdocs.org/ >MkDocs</a> using <a href=https://github.com/gristlabs/mkdocs-windmill>Windmill</a> theme by Grist Labs.</p> </footer> </body> </html>
