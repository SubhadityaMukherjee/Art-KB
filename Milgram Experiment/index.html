Conducted only three months after the start of the trial of German Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann, Milgram’s experiment sought to answer the question, &lsquo;Could it be that Eichmann and his million accomplices in the Holocaust were just following orders?&rsquo; In the experiment, two participants (one secretly an actor and one an unwitting test subject) were separated into two rooms where they could hear, but not see, each other. The test subject would then read a series of questions to the actor, punishing each wrong answer with an electric shock. Though many people would indicate their desire to stop the experiment, almost all subjects continued when they were told they would not be held responsible, or that there would not be any permanent damage.</li> <li>Participants were randomly assigned to either the role of prisoner or guard in a simulated prison environment. There were two reserves, and one dropped out, finally leaving ten prisoners and 11 guards.</li> <li>Prisoners were treated like every other criminal, being arrested at their own homes, without warning, and taken to the local police station. They were fingerprinted, photographed and ‘booked.’</li> <li>Then they were blindfolded and driven to the psychology department of Stanford University, where Zimbardo had had the basement set out as a prison, with barred doors and windows, bare walls and small cells. Here the deindividuation process began.</li> <li>When the prisoners arrived at the prison they were stripped naked, deloused, had all their personal possessions removed and locked away, and were given prison clothes and bedding. They were issued a uniform, and referred to by their number only.</li> <li>Their clothes comprised a smock with their number written on it, but no underclothes. They also had a tight nylon cap to cover their hair, and a locked chain around one ankle.</li> <li>Guards also wore special sunglasses, to make eye contact with prisoners impossible.</li> <li>Three guards worked shifts of eight hours each (the other guards remained on call). Guards were instructed to do whatever they thought was necessary to maintain law and order in the prison and to command the respect of the prisoners. No physical violence was permitted.</li> <li>The prisoners soon adopted prisoner-like behavior too. They talked about prison issues a great deal of the time. They ‘told tales’ on each other to the guards.</li> <li>Push-ups were a common form of physical punishment imposed by the guards. One of the guards stepped on the prisoners&rsquo; backs while they did push-ups, or made other prisoners sit on the backs of fellow prisoners doing their push-ups.</li> <li>During the second day of the experiment, the prisoners removed their stocking caps, ripped off their numbers, and barricaded themselves inside the cells by putting their beds against the door.</li> <li>The ringleaders of the prisoner rebellion were placed into solitary confinement. After this, the guards generally began to harass and intimidate the prisoners.</li> <li>Privileged prisoners also got to eat special food in the presence of the other prisoners who had temporarily lost the privilege of eating. The effect was to break the solidarity among prisoners.</li> <li>As the prisoners became more submissive, the guards became more aggressive and assertive. They demanded ever greater obedience from the prisoners. The prisoners were dependent on the guards for everything so tried to find ways to please the guards, such as telling tales on fellow prisoners.</li> <li>Less than 36 hours into the experiment, Prisoner <code>#</code>8612 began suffering from acute emotional disturbance, disorganized thinking, uncontrollable crying, and rage.</li> <li>Soon <code>#</code>8612 &lsquo;began to act ‘crazy,’ to scream, to curse, to go into a rage that seemed out of control.&rsquo; It wasn’t until this point that the psychologists realized they had to let him out.</li> <li>The next day, the guards held a visiting hour for parents and friends. They were worried that when the parents saw the state of the jail, they might insist on taking their sons home. Guards washed the prisoners, had them clean and polish their cells, fed them a big dinner and played music on the intercom.</li> <li>Zimbardo invited a Catholic priest who had been a prison chaplain to evaluate how realistic our prison situation was. Half of the prisoners introduced themselves by their number rather than name.</li> <li>Eventually while talking to the priest, <code>#</code>819 broke down and began to cry hysterically, just two previously released prisoners had. The psychologists removed the chain from his foot, the cap off his head, and told him to go and rest in a room that was adjacent to the prison yard. They told him they would get him some food and then take him to see a doctor.</li> <li>At that point, Zimbardo said, &ldquo;Listen, you are not <code>#</code>819. You are , and my name is Dr. Zimbardo. I am a psychologist, not a prison superintendent, and this is not a real prison. This is just an experiment, and those are students, not prisoners, just like you. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</li> <li>‘Most of the participants said they had felt involved and committed. The research had felt &ldquo;real&rdquo; to them. One guard said, &ldquo;I was surprised at myself. I made them call each other names and clean the toilets out with their bare hands. I practically considered the prisoners cattle and I kept thinking I had to watch out for them in case they tried something.&rdquo;</li> </ul> <br> <div class="row wm-article-nav-buttons" role=navigation aria-label=navigation> <div class="wm-article-nav pull-right"> <a href=../Milgram%20Shock%20Experiments/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-right"> Next <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden=true></i> </a> <a href=../Milgram%20Shock%20Experiments/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Milgram Shock Experiments </a> </div> <div class=wm-article-nav> <a href=../Mi%20Le%20Fo/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-left"> <i class="fa fa-chevron-left" aria-hidden=true></i> Previous</a><a href=../Mi%20Le%20Fo/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Mi Le Fo </a> </div> </div> <br> </div> <footer class="container-fluid wm-page-content"> <p>Documentation built with <a href=https://www.mkdocs.org/ >MkDocs</a> using <a href=https://github.com/gristlabs/mkdocs-windmill>Windmill</a> theme by Grist Labs.</p> </footer> </body> </html>
