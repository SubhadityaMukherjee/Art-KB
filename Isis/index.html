She was associated with virtually every aspect of human life and, in time, became elevated to the position of supreme deity, &ldquo;Mother of the Gods&rdquo;, who cared for her fellow deities as she did for human beings. She is the second-born of the First Five Gods (Osiris, Isis, Set, <a href=../Nephthys/ >Nephthys</a>, and Horus the Elder), sister-wife of Osiris, mother of Horus the Younger, and symbolically understood as the mother of every king. Her Egyptian name, Eset, means &ldquo;Goddess of the Throne&rdquo; because of her association with the monarch. She was also known as Weret-Kekau, &ldquo;The Great Magic&rdquo;, because of her incredible powers. She cared for people in life and appeared to them after death to help guide them safely to paradise. After the conquest of Egypt by Alexander_the_Great in 331 BCE, her worship traveled to Greece and then to Rome. During the time of the Roman_Empire, she was worshipped in every corner of their realm from britain through europe to Asia_Minor. The Cult of Isis was the strongest opponent of the new religion of christianity between the 4th-6th centuries CE, and iconography, as well as tenets of belief, of the Isis cult were incorporated into the new faith. Imagery of the Virgin Mary holding her son Jesus_Christ comes directly from Isis cradling her son Horus and the Dying and Reviving God figure of Jesus himself is a version of Osiris.</li> </ul> <br> <div class="row wm-article-nav-buttons" role=navigation aria-label=navigation> <div class="wm-article-nav pull-right"> <a href=../Italian%20Seasoning/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-right"> Next <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden=true></i> </a> <a href=../Italian%20Seasoning/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Italian Seasoning </a> </div> <div class=wm-article-nav> <a href=../Isis-Eutheria/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-left"> <i class="fa fa-chevron-left" aria-hidden=true></i> Previous</a><a href=../Isis-Eutheria/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Isis-Eutheria </a> </div> </div> <br> </div> <footer class="container-fluid wm-page-content"> <p>Documentation built with <a href=https://www.mkdocs.org/ >MkDocs</a> using <a href=https://github.com/gristlabs/mkdocs-windmill>Windmill</a> theme by Grist Labs.</p> </footer> </body> </html>
