The kitchen and dining room will be found on the first floor. The second floor is used as warehousing, and the third and fourth floors contain bedrooms. The inner circle is 2-storied with 30 to 50 rooms which function as guesthouses. In the middle is a rectangular hall, a public place for several hundred inhabitants.</li> <li>Actually the Tulou were built by a minority called the Hakka, who were originally Han who fled south to escape war and famine during the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC). As they gradually moved they changed the local architecture by incorporating Han styles and that produced the tulou. Not only were the high walls built for defense but they were also the result of traditional Han architecture</li> <li>The oldest one was constructed over 1,200 years ago and is regarded as a &ldquo;living fossil&rdquo; of the construction style of central China . There are three types of tulou.</li> <li>The Wufeng has three halls and two side rooms and are said to be the result of a redesign of the Han courtyard. The oldest tulou are the rectangle ones, and the most emblematic ones are round. They are typically designed for defensive purposes and consist of one entrance and no windows at ground level.</li> <li>The biggest round one can have up to five stories with three interior rings.</li> <li>Most round tulous are three or four stories, with family kitchens and livestock on the ground floor. The next floor becomes a storage room for food and furniture (with no windows), and above that are the bedrooms</li> <li>These structures are exemplary of sustainable architecture in that they are built of local, natural materials with simple techniques. They have good thermal attributes, with the massive earthen walls to help buffer temperatures. They are obviously built to last, and house many of the necessities for life. And they embody a communal life style that conserves energy and resources; these represent a form of ancient co-housing.</li> <li><img alt src=../assets/Pasted%20image%2020221007111036.png></li> <li><img alt src=../assets/Pasted%20image%2020221007111043.png></li> <li><img alt src=../assets/Pasted%20image%2020221007111053.png></li> <li><img alt src=../assets/Pasted%20image%2020221007111101.png></li> <li><img alt src=../assets/Pasted%20image%2020221007111111.png></li> </ul> <br> <div class="row wm-article-nav-buttons" role=navigation aria-label=navigation> <div class="wm-article-nav pull-right"> <a href=../Tulus/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-right"> Next <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden=true></i> </a> <a href=../Tulus/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Tulus </a> </div> <div class=wm-article-nav> <a href=../Tuber/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-left"> <i class="fa fa-chevron-left" aria-hidden=true></i> Previous</a><a href=../Tuber/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Tuber </a> </div> </div> <br> </div> <footer class="container-fluid wm-page-content"> <p>Documentation built with <a href=https://www.mkdocs.org/ >MkDocs</a> using <a href=https://github.com/gristlabs/mkdocs-windmill>Windmill</a> theme by Grist Labs.</p> </footer> </body> </html>
