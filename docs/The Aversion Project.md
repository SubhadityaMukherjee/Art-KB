# The Aversion Project

- They didnâ€™t like gay people in apartheid-era South Africa. Especially in the armed forces. How they got rid of them is shocking. Using army psychiatrists and military chaplains, who were, presumably privy to private, 'confidential' confessions, the apartheid regime flushed out homosexuals in the armed forces. But it did not evict them from the military. The homosexual 'undesirables' were sent to a military hospital near Pretoria, to a place called Ward 22 (which in itself sounds terrifying).
- There, between 1971 and 1989, many victims were submitted to chemical castrations and electric shock treatment, meant to cure them of their homosexual 'condition.' As many as 900 homosexuals, mostly 16-24 years old who had been drafted and had not voluntarily joined the military, were subjected to forced '[Sexual Reassignment](sexual%20reassignment.md)' surgeries. Men were surgically turned into women against their will, then cast out into the world, the gender reassignment often incomplete, and without the means to pay for expensive hormones to maintain their new sexual identities.
- The head of this project, Dr. Aubrey Levin, went on to become a clinical professor at the University of Calgary. That is until 2010, when his license was suspended for making sexual advances towards a male student. He was sentenced to five years in prison for other sexual assaults (against males).
