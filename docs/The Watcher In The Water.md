# The Watcher In The Water

- There are many mysterious creatures lurking in Middle-earth, but above all, the Watcher in the Water stands alone as the most mysterious one. We’ve never seen another specimen of the being than the one lurking in the waters in front of the entrance to the Mines of Moria. The creature resembles a Kraken, with over twenty tentacles.
- The creature, or the species, doesn’t really have a name – it’s only known as the Watcher in the Water. It grabbed Frodo as the Fellowship arrived in Moria, and the entire group barely saved their butts by entering the Mines and fleeing.
- If we knew more, the Watcher would probably be ranked even higher, but maybe the mystery around the Watcher gives the creature another layer of awesomeness.
