# Mount Diwata Deities
- a group of deities (diwata) at the Diwata Mountains, whose privacy was subjugated by the noise created by the hornbills (kalaw)
- the oldest among them used her wooden staff and tapped in on the ground three times, which made their home flew up and became the island of [Camiguin](Camiguin.md)
- a crater was left, which became Lake Mainit
