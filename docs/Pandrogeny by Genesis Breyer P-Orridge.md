# Pandrogeny by Genesis Breyer P-Orridge
- Born Neil Andrew Megson, Genesis Breyer P-Orridge is a flag bearer of numerous art movements, fronting the formative bands Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV, among the hundreds of releases s/he's credited on. Throughout the avant achievements of P-Orridge, however, the most remarkable is h/er transformation with h/er love, Lady Jaye Breyer P-Orridge, into a singular pandrogynous being. As the artist puts it: "Their work documents the physical alterations s/he and the late Lady Jaye, endured within their project Pandrogeny, about re-union and re-solution of male and female to a perfecting hermaphroditic state." In short, the duo attempted to become the singular entity that their union inspired.
