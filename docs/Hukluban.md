- She had the power to change herself into any form she desired. She could kill anyone by simply raising her hand. However, if she wanted to heal those whom she had made ill by her charms, she could do so without any difficulty. It was also said of her that she could destroy a house by merely saying that she would do so. Mentioned by Juan de Plasencia in "Customs of the Tagalogs" (1589) as a type of witch or class of priest. Among the peasants of the province of Bulacan), Hokloban was a wise old man, almost a magician, who was consulted, and who came to an extremely advanced age, thus being a kind of Methuselah) of the Tagalogs. The phrase "matandang Hokloban" (old Hokloban) that applies to the long-lived is still very common.
