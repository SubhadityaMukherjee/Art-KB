# Old Chinese Decoration
- timber
- Wooden posts, beams, lintels and joists make up the framework of a house
- Walls serve as the separation of rooms without bearing the weight of the whole house, which is unique to China. As a famous saying goes
- Colored glaze roofs, windows with exquisite applique design and beautiful flower patterns on wooden pillars reflect the high-level of the craftsmen's handicraft and their rich imagination.
- The main structure is located on the central axis of a court while less-important structures are located to the left and right
- Compared with European architectural style which is open and shut, a courtyard is like a hand scroll of painting which should be unfolded little by little
- Likewise from the interior of the buildings the view from two windows is never the same.
