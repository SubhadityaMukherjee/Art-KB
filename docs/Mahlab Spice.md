# Mahlab Spice
- These pits add an ultra-luxurious almond, nutty, slightly vanilla flavor with a slightly bitter after taste. We love to add this Mahlab spice powder to baked goods like pastries, bread, rice pudding, honey, and cheese desserts and is frequently found throughout Greece, Turkey, and Egypt.
