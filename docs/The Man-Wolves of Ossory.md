# The Man-Wolves of Ossory

- Hmm. In hindsight, maybe the Man-Wolves of Ossory should have been put with the Celtic monsters at the beginningâ€¦
- The motif of Man-Wolves of Ossory is quite strong in Irish mythology and many old tales revolved around these tribes of wolf-men.
- Ancient kings of Ireland used to seek their assistance during war times when they were going up against a fierce opponent.
