# Herbes De Provence
- This simple, yet elegant blend of dried herbs and lavender buds were bundled in the Provencal countryside and can turn basic meals into a flavor-packed, dinner party level dish. It can even take your popcorn to the next level when paired with asiago cheese! We love to pair this with anything from baked eggs and garlic bread to roasted fish or flourless cake.
