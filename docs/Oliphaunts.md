# Oliphaunts

- These creatures are usually known as Mûmakils in Tolkien’s writings, but you probably know them under the name Oliphaunts, which Legolas calls them when they first appeared in The Two Towers, and subsequently in The Return of the King. Mûmakils are virtually giant, highly-intelligent elephants with two sets of tusks, growing up to a staggering 90 feet.
- They are essentially only used in battle by a certain race of Men, the Haradrim, who were a part of Sauron’s evil army. The Oliphaunts can decimate an entire cohort of horsemen with a single swipe of their long, powerful tusks, which are usually equipped with spikes or barbed wire. They are truly menacing creatures, as their skin is so strong you can hardly harm them.
