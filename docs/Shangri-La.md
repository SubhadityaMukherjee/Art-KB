# Shangri-La
- Merriam-Webster defines Shangri-La as a synonym of Utopia: 'a remote beautiful imaginary place where life approaches perfection'. From the mind of British author James Hilton, the term first entered public consciousness in Lost Horizon (1933) as a reimagining of an ancient fictional paradise: Tibet’s Shambala Kingdom. Though thought to be the birthplace of Vishnu’s final reincarnation by Hindus, legends and mentions of this joyful paradise in the form of a Himalayan valley separated from the known world were around long before this organised religion. Hilton’s book popularised the myth in the West by having the hero of his tale find ultimate joy and fulfilment among the wise, immortal beings of Shangri-La.
