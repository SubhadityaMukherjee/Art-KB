# Balor of the Evil Eye

- The leader of supernatural creatures called the Fomorians, Balor of the Evil Eye, one of many Irish demons, was, unsurprisingly enough, a giant with a large eye.
- While he was spying on his fatherâ€™s druids, the noisome vapours of a spell entered his eye. The eye became swollen and granted him the power of death.
