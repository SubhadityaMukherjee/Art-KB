# Mysterious Memories

- Mexican painter (<https://mymodernmet.com/frida-kahlo-paintings/)> is known for her collection of 55 self-portraits. While her most well-known works feature the artist as an adult, she also portrayed herself as a child in _Girl with Death Mask (She Plays Alone)_.
- This peculiar piece depicts a young girl standing before a barren landscape. In her hand, she holds a single yellow flower and, on her face, she wears a skull mask. Both of these props are characteristic of _Día de los Muertos—_or Day of the Dead— prompting the viewer to reflect upon themes related to death. Finally, a beastly mask rests at her feet, adding even more mystery to the chilling painting.
- _Girl with Death Mask (She Plays Alone)_ was painted in 1938—the year before her dramatic divorce from fellow artist Diego Rivera. Like many works created during this time, this piece was likely inspired by Kahlo's feelings of isolation and loneliness. 'I paint self-portraits because I am so often alone,' the artist famously said, 'because I am the person I know best.'
