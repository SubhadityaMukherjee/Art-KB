# Dijiang (帝江)
- One of the weirdest Chinese mythical creatures 'recorded'  
	in Shan Hai Jing, the Dijiang is a crimson, six-legged, four-winged  
	creature with no facial features. This strange paranormal beast was also  
	written about by Taoist sage Zhuangzi. In 2021, the Dijiang enjoyed its  
	first worldwide cinematic debut when it was featured as an animal companion  
	in the Marvel Studios movie, _Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings_.
