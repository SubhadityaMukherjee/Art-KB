# Basilisk

- Basilisk is a legendary giant reptile in European mythology which was known as the king of serpents. The word basilisk is derived from the Greek word _basiliskos_ meaning 'a kind of serpent'.
- There are three ways the basilisk was depicted in the myths: a giant snake, an enormous lizard or a reptile with scaly wings and some features of a roster like feathers, legs and head.
- According to the belief, the basilisk could kill anything with just looking in its eyes much like Gorgons in Greek mythology.
- Some other myths suggest that the basilisk could fly, deliver venom by biting its prey and/or breathe fire.
