# [[Hera]]
- Hera is known as the queen of Greek gods, given that she was the wife of [Zeus](Zeus.md). In Roman mythology, she is known as Juno, which is a cute variation. She is known as the goddess of marriage (even though she put up with [Zeus](Zeus.md)â€™ many infidelities) and as a protector. If you want to give your child the name of a very good queen, this is it.
- Goddess of women, marriage and family. Wife of [Zeus](Zeus.md).
