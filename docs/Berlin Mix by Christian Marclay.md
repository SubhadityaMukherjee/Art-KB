# Berlin Mix by Christian Marclay
- Christian Marclay has a fantastic reputation for using phonographic records as a medium for his work, unwittingly contributing to the noise and turntablism movements with his cut-and-paste collage techniques. However, his live performances are sometimes less-than legendary-that is, until his 2009 assembled performance he called Berlin Mix. There, Marclay accomplished live what heretofore had been achieved with tape loops and turntablist techniques. Assembling hundreds of performers in many disparate forms and genres, Marclay acted as the conductor from a podium in the center of a Berlin former train shed. The result was a live, "simultaneous concert," an illuminating and fascinating pastiche of contemporary music.
