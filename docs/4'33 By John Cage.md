# 4'33" By John Cage
- The silence of a room carried significant artistic weight for John Cage, especially after he tried to isolate himself in an anechoic-utterly soundproof-chamber at Harvard. The story goes that when he left the room, he told the engineer there that he could still hear two noises while inside the chamber, one low-pitched and one high-pitched. The engineer told him one was his nervous system operating, the other the flow of blood through his veins. The idea of unachievable silence consumed Cage and the result was 4'33", a three-movement piece for any number of performers.
