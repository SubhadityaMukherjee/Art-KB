# Sunat
- A well-known priest. Brother of [Asuan](Asuan.md). Mentioned by Juan de Plasencia in "Customs of the Tagalogs" (1589) as a type of witch or class of priest. According to Plasencia, a sonat is a high priest/priestess equivalent of that of a Bishop. In Old_Tagalog), sonat also signified Circumcision), it alluded to the ritual of circumcision of Filipino girls upon coming of age by the chief priestess. In suppressing the priestesses, the missionaries unwittingly made one of their greatest contributions to the welfare of Filipino women - the abolition of what is now known as "Female_genital_mutilation)" which, unfortunately, still survives in other developing countries.
