# Yayu (猰貐)
- In ancient Chinese myths, Yayu was a benevolent supernatural  
	creature that was unfortunately killed by Wei, one of the 28 Constellation  
	Gods. After resurrection by heaven, Yayu transformed into a savage,  
	man-eating beast. Yayu was ultimately killed again by the legendary Chinese  
	archer, Hou Yi.
