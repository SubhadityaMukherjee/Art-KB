# Ladon

- Ladon, also known as the Hesperian Dragon, was a dragon with hundred heads that guarded the golden apples of Hesperides.
- Stealing the golden apples of Hesperides was the eleventh labor of Hercules set by King Eurystheus.
- After wandering Egypt, Libya and Asia for a long while, Hercules finally found the garden, killed Ladon and stole the golden apples.
