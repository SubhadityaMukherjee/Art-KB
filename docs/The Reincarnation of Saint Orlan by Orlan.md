# The Reincarnation of Saint Orlan by Orlan
- French artist Orlan’s most famous performance piece saw her go through nine plastic surgeries from 1990 to 1995 in order to adopt characteristics of the women of famous artworks. Orlan was not trying to make herself more beautiful through the surgeries; rather she aimed to use her body as a canvas to challenge ideas about bodies and beauty. Through her implants and operations Orlan ended up with the chin of Botticelli’s Venus, the nose of Jean-Léon Gérôme’s Psyche, the lips of François Boucher’s Europa, the eyes of Diana, and the forehead of Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. Her surgeries were another performance in themselves: Orlan lay fully conscious during the surgeries, listening to poetry and music, in costume, and occasionally with performing dancers while filming and broadcasting each feat.
