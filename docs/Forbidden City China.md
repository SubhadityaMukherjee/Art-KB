# Forbidden City China
- The general layout often follows two rules: the first being the ancestral temples must be situated at the front left of the main palace as the left is believed to be superior, while the front right was reserved for altars for praying to the gods of earth and grain. It is called 'Zuozu Youshe' in Chinese.
- The second being emperors handled national affairs at the palace's forecourt while the rear end was meant for living. In Chinese, this structure is called 'Qianchao Houqin'
- Many distinctive characters were incorporated to indicate the imperial palace
- For example, a pair of stone or copper lion often crouches in front of the main gate to ward off evil influence.
- Ornamental Columns with exquisite floral designs
- Auspicious jars with water in front of palace -> Also fire extinguishers : Menhai (sea of the front door)
