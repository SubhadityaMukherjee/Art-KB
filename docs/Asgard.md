# Asgard
- Another one of the Nine Worlds is Asgard, home of the warrior gods or Aesir. Ruled over by Odin and his queen, Frigg, it’s connected to the land of mortal humans, Midgard, via a rainbow bridge: the Bifröst. Beyond Asgard lies Valhalla, Odin’s fabulous hall where the greatest warriors gather, as well as several gold and silver mansions for each god and goddess. It’s in many ways the Norse equivalent to the Greeks’ Mount Olympus, with both deity populations frequently getting rowdy on honey-based spirits.
