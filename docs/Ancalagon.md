# Ancalagon

- Ancalagon the Black was a dreadful creature, so evil that he served as Morgoth’s mightiest weapon. He was by far the largest winged dragon ever to existIt’s unclear exactly how large that was, but all you need to know is that, when he died and fell from the skies, his body leveled an entire mountain range. Not a mountain – an entire range.
- Ancalagon led Morgoth’s army of fire Drakes into the War of Wrath, a battle against Valar – Melkor’s kin before he became corrupted. In all his might, Ancalagon was eventually defeated by the Great Eagles and their king, Thorondor, with huge help of Eärendil, the one who carried the Silmaril.
