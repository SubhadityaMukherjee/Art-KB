# [Dragon](Dragon.md)
- The dragon is the oldest symbol of a deity found in China. The dragon symbol appears on [pottery](https://www.worldhistory.org/pottery/) found at the [Neolithic](https://www.worldhistory.org/Neolithic/) site of [Banpo Village](https://www.worldhistory.org/Banpo_Village/) dating from between c. 4500-3750 BCE. Dragon was considered a composite of [yin and yang](https://www.worldhistory.org/Yin_and_Yang/) energies and was originally seen as a balancing force who was wise and just. The dragon Yinglong was known as The Dragon King and god of rain and waters. As god of the sea, he was known as Hong Shen and was prayed to regularly by sailors and fishermen, but farmers who needed rain for their crops worshipped Dragon as well. He is also shown in human form as a wise man with the full sun behind his head watching over a boat full of people.
