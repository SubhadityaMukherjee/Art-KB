# Carcharoth & Draugluin

- Carcharoth and Draugluin are werewolves in Tolkien’s universe. Now, they aren’t really the same as the traditional depiction of werewolves – howling at the moon, changing forms when it’s the full moon, etc. Instead, Morgoth created Draugluin as the first of its kind. Draugluin was a wolf that the Dark Lord merged with an evil spirit, creating the first werewolf.
- Now, Draugluin was powerful, but Carcharoth was a new step in Morgoth’s creation. He was a direct descendant of Draugluin, fed with magically-enhanced living flesh, and enraged all the time to be as vile and as aggressive as possible. Carcharoth’s diet caused him to grow to an enormous size, and always be hungry for flesh and blood.
- The werewolf had glowing eyes, teeth infused with poison, and was really a beast to be reckoned with. Aragorn’s ancestor, Beren Erchamion, learned that from the first hand, when, ironically, Carcharoth bit off his entire hand with a single snap of its giant jaws.
