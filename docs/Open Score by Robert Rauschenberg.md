# Open Score by Robert Rauschenberg
- Robert Rauschenberg, alongside a forum called E.A.T. (experiments in art and technology) organized a nine-night series of early experiments fusing art and technology in 1966. For the event, Rauschenberg himself created one of his best-known action works, Open Score. It consisted of three parts: the first was a tennis match between painter Frank Stella and Mimi Kanarek. Their tennis rackets were wired to transmit acoustic transmissions whenever a ball was struck. In addition, each sound would trigger the spotlights around the armory the action was performed in to turn off. The second part of the piece was the projection of infrared footage of 500 people walking through the darkness. The audience could only see the crowd through the projections. In the second of the two performances of Open Score, Rauschenberg added a third section, where a spotlight illuminated a girl in a clothe sack singing a Tuscan folk song.
