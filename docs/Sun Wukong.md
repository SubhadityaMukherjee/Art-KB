# Sun Wukong 
- The world-famous protagonist of _Journey to the West_, Sun Wukong the Monkey King was born from a magical rock. Mischievous, fiercely loyal, and very quick-tempered, Sun repeatedly battled the Taoist pantheon, and after defeat, was imprisoned by Gautama Buddha in a magical mountain. To further atone for his sins, he was later also ordered to protect [Tang Sanzang](Tang%20Sanzang.md) during the holy monk’s pilgrimage to the birthplace of Buddhism. Upon completion of the pilgrimage, Sun Wukong achieved Buddhist enlightenment and was conferred the title of Dou Zan Sheng Fo (斗战胜佛, Buddha of Combat). Till today, Sun Wukong remains one of the most beloved characters in Chinese mythology.
