# Guhuo Niao (姑获鸟)
- A nine-headed demonic bird mentioned in several  
	ancient Chinese texts. The medicinal compendium, _Benchao Gangmu,_  
	describes it as the supernatural manifestation of women who died in  
	childbirth. Some descriptions also state that the Guhuo Niao often cradles  
	kidnapped children.
