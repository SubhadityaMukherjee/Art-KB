# Dragons

- In Tolkien’s world, dragons are probably the most powerful creatures to ever exist – and also the vilest and most devious. There were a whole lot more of them during the First Age, but by the Third Age, Smaug was considered the last of the great dragons to exist. They could breathe mist and fire, and decimate cities in a single flight.
- Dragons are divided into winged, and non-winged dragons, who appeared slick and slender, but huge, like giant lizards, if you will, called Long-worms. They were highly intelligent and could speak, had an incredibly strong love for power and wealth, amassing huge piles of gold and treasure.
- It’s hard to say which were more powerful, as both types of dragons were almost impossible to kill.
- Just look at Smaug – he wasn’t the largest, smartest, or strongest of his kind, but had it not been for the missing scale in his armor, and some spectacular shooting from Bard, it’s highly likely that nothing could stop Smaug on his fiery rampage. Throughout history, Scatha the Worm was probably the Long-worm equivalent to Smaug, power-wise, and wealth-wise.
- That being said, neither were the most powerful of their kind. Here are those who were.
