# Four Sons of Horus
- Four deities, [Duamutef](Duamutef.md), [Hapy](Hapy.md), Imset, and Qebehsenuef, who watched over the viscera or the dead in the four canopic jars placed in the tomb. Each had his own cardinal point to guard, his own internal organ to protect, and was watched over by a specific goddess.
