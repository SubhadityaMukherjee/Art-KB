# Nan Ji Xian Weng 
- The Divine Sage of the South Pole is a minor character in _Investiture of the Gods_, one who occasionally assisted the Zhou forces in his role as the eldest disciple of [[Yuan Shi Tian Jun.md]]. Outside of that, the immortal also appears in several other classical works and is commonly associated with longevity by the Chinese. Some consider him to be the “Shou” of the San Xing as well.
