# Hua Shan Sheng Mu 
- The protagonist of _The Lotus Lantern_ opera is an illegitimate niece of the Jade Emperor and the owner of an all-powerful magical lantern. After marrying a mortal, she was punished for the “transgression” by being imprisoned under Mount Hua. In all versions of the myth, her son Chen Xiang subsequently freed her by splitting the mountain apart. He succeeded in doing so after defeating Hua Shan Sheng Mu’s brother Erlang Shen (see above). The latter had earlier swindled away his mother’s precious lantern.
