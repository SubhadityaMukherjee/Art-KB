# The Nazgul

- The Nazgul, aka the Black Riders, aka the Ring Wraiths, were Sauronâ€™s evil servants, army captains, and probably the most powerful weapon in his arsenal. They are called the Ring Wraiths because all Nazgul had Rings of Power in the past. The powers corrupted them, slowly turning them into evil spirits instead of living, breathing beings.
- The leader of the Nazgul is the Witch-king of Angmar, and they are almost impossible to kill or defeat. The Nazgul ride on the backs of Fellbeasts and are probably the most menacing creatures in the entire Lord of the Rings universe.
