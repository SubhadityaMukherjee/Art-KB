# The Dullahan

- People tend to view faeries as happy little Irish mythological creatures that possess a variety of magical powers.
- Our next creature, the Dullahan, is a faerie that you’d struggle to describe as ‘happy’, as it takes the form of a headless rider on a black horse.
- According to legend, this Irish folklore creature uses the spine of a human as a whip. The Dullahan can also foreshadow deaths. If he calls out your name, you will immediately drop dead.
