# Acciones Urbanas by Elvira Santamaría
- Elvira Santamaría’s politically-charged Urban Actions depicts the mourning of decades of violence in Colombia. The Mexican artist honors the victims of the corrupt country by covering herself in white and red carnations and solemnly walking through or lying in public spaces. Although her work is not outwardly shocking, her attempt to build empathy through reminding passers-by of their sorrows and their anxieties makes an impact on an individual scale. Santamaría intends to build herself as a symbol of hope in renewal for the future.
