# Ents

- The Ents are my favorite species from Tolkien’s lore. You probably remember their leader, Treebeard, who encountered Merry and Pippin in The Two Towers. Ents are the guardians of the forest – one might call them living trees, although Treebeard was always adamant about not being a tree, but an Ent. When they are asleep, though, you can’t really tell the difference.
- Ents can walk, talk, think, fight, and live for hundreds of years. They stay away from conflict unless somebody hurts the forest. That’s when things get serious. When Treebeard and the Entmoot (the Ent council) saw what Saruman was doing to the woods near Isengard, they completely decimated Isengard by flooding it, trapping the wizard in his tower.
