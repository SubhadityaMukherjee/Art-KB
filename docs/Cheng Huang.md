# Cheng Huang 
- The Taoist City God, or more accurately, the God of the City Moat. Cheng Huang is a title rather than an individual deity. Many Chinese folkloric beliefs also state that Cheng Huang are the immortals responsible for keeping records of human virtues and wrong-doings, and for submitting these records to hell.
