# Sui, Tang, Song Dynasties Clothes
- (589-618 AD)
- The Sui Dynasty and Tang dynasties were "China's golden age", when the Han culture broadened. Based on their predecessors, a clothing style combining elements of the Hanfu and the hufu became common.
- Women's clothes became more relaxed and revealing than their previous counterparts, owing to women being less restricted by the Confucian ethical codes.
- The clothes of the Song Dynasty largely continued the style of the Tang Dynasty. More decorations and embroidery were applied. Women in the Song Dynasty wore beizi (褙子，similar to capes).
- After the reign of Tang Emperor Gaozong, purple was used as the garment color for officials above the third grade; light red, officials above the fifth grade; dark green, officials above the sixth grade; light green, officials above the seventh grade; dark cyan, officials above the eighth grade; light cyan, officials above the ninth grade; and yellow, ordinary people and those who did not live in the palace.
- Grace, naturalism, elegance and romance became hallmarks of this dynasty
-  The garments in the Tang Dynasty also greatly affected the garments of neighboring countries. For instance, Japanese kimono adopted the elites of the dresses of the Tang Dynasty in terms of colors, and the Hanbok (traditional Korean clothing) also adopted the advantages of the dresses of the Tang Dynasty.
- The dresses of the Tang Dynasty were mainly made of silk
- Pao (gown) fell into two types: with broad sleeves and with narrow sleeves. The gown for an official was made of brocade, and that for a non-official was  
   made of white cloth.  
- Ru (jacket) and Ao (coat) were the necessary costumes for common people in their daily life.  
- Duanhe (coarse cloth jacket) was short clothes made of coarse cloth worn by poor people.  
- Lanshan (scholar's blouse) was a kind of men's long robes with a lateral ribbon attached to the lower hem.  
- Shan (lower garment) followed the ancient code of upper garment (jacket and blouse) and lower garment (skirt), and it was the style of Mianfu (mitral garment), Chaofu (court robe) or Sijufu (private garment).  
- Zhiduo (straight long robe) was a long loose robe without split at the lower  part (but there was central seam on the back part).  
- Hechang (cloak made of cranes' down) was long and loose. It was a kind of precious fur coat made of down of crane and other birds. Its lower hem reached the ground.
