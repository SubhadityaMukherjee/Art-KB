# Glaurung

- What Ancalagon the Black is to winged dragons, Glaurung the Great Worm is to Long-worms. He was the largest, most powerful, deadliest non-winged dragon to ever exist. In fact, he was the only dragon that could ever beat Ancalagon. You see, Glaurung was Morgoth’s first attempt at creating the ultimate weapon – and boy, did he succeed.
- Melkor spent a millennium in Angbard, trying to create such a weapon, and eventually, Glaurung was born. Morgoth and Glaurung flattened countless cities, but even Melkor couldn’t predict what kind of bloodlust and thirst for complete destruction of all life the Great Worm would have. That’s why Morgoth held him locked up in Angbard in between battles.
- Glaurung could not only spit fire and mist, and decimate cities with his sheer size – he could also control minds, erase memories, and cast spells, simply by looking you into the eyes. The Dragon King ruled for years over Long-worms before eventually passing in the depths of Angbard.
