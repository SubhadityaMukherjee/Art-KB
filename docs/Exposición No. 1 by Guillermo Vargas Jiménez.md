# Exposición No. 1 by Guillermo Vargas Jiménez
- Guillermo Vargas Jiménez received death threats after his controversial exhibition in Nicaragua featured an emaciated dog with ‘You Are What You Read’ written on the wall in dog food. It was reported that the dog had starved to death as part of Vargas’s work, but the director of the gallery claimed the dog was fed regularly and was only tied up for three hours one day before it escaped. Vargas has refused to comment on the fate of the dog but said that no visitors made any attempt to free the dog, give it food, or even call the police. Jiménez’s work aimed to call out hypocrisy; the dog had been carelessly looked over in the streets, but once he put it in a gallery people started to care about it.
