# Nehebkau (Nehebu-Kau)
- "He Who Unites the Ka", was a protector god who joined the _ka_ (aspect of the soul) to the body at birth and united the _ka_ with the _ba_ (winged aspect of the soul) after death. He is depicted as a serpent and, like Heka, has always existed. Nehebkau swam in the primordial waters at the dawn of creation before Atum rose from the chaos to impose order.
