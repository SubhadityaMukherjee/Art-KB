# Pan Gu
- Born from a cosmic egg, Pangu was the Chinese mythical creator of the world and the very first living being in the universe. Using his magical ax, he separated Yang and Yin, and pushed the sky till it was high above the earth. After his passing, different parts of his body also became natural elements such as the wind and the stars.
