# Dong Yong 
- Impoverished Dong Yong was forced to sell himself into slavery in order to pay for his father’s funeral. His piety moved the Seventh Fairy, or Qi Xian Nü, the latter then magically weaving # bolts of splendid cloth overnight to redeem him from indenture. The couple subsequently married but unfortunately had to be separated when Qi Xian Nü was forced to return to heaven.
