# Pickling Spices
- This classic pickling spice merges classic dill seed and black peppercorn with red pepper flakes for heat plus mustard seeds and coriander for warmth. We especially love this blend with green vegetables like zucchini, beets, cucumbers, Brussel sprouts, and green beans. Tie in cheesecloth and add to your pickling jar, then remove when finished.
