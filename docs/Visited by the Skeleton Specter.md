# Visited by the Skeleton Specter

- Utagawa Kuniyoshi, 'Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Specter' c. 1844 (Photo: (<https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Takiyasha_the_Witch_and_the_Skeleton_Spectre.jpg),> Public domain)
- Edo period artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi created the woodblock print _Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Specter_, in which a giant skeleton looms over two samurais as a woman reads a scroll in the wings. The unsettling image is based on a story from the Heian period in Japan that took place in 939 CE.
- At that time, samurai warlord Taira no Masakado traveled from his home in Kantō and led an army to rally against the central government in Kyoto. He eventually tried to set up an 'Eastern Court' in Shimōsa Province but was defeated and decapitated. His daughter, Princess Takiyasha, continued to live in the family’s shōen, turning to witchcraft and studying dark magic.
- Kuniyoshi's piece shows her reading a spell to bring forth a _Gashadokuro_, a spirit that takes the form of a giant skeleton. It looks over Ōya Taro Mitsukuni and another samurai who were both sent to get the princess. Their plans were foiled by the haunting spirit.
