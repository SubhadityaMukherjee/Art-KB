# Triadic Ballet by Oskar Schlemmer
- Oskar Schlemmer's radical notion that all art, including dance, was artificial in part led to his Triadic Ballet, one of the most widely performed avant-garde dances. A major signal of the Bauhuas movement, Triadic Ballet cemented its place in history as one of the first examples of multimedia performance. Schlemmer even created his costumes first, and then designed the choreography around them; however, the original choreography has since been lost and is recreated based on research and intuition.Oskar Schlemmer's radical notion that all art, including dance, was artificial in part led to his Triadic Ballet, one of the most widely performed avant-garde dances.
