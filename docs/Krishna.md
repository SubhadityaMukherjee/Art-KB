- Krishna is the god of compassion, tenderness, protection, and love. According to most stories, Krishna is the eighth avatar of Vishnu and is worshipped as a supreme god too. One of his principal symbols is the flute, which he uses for seductive purposes.
- In many of his depictions, Krishna is a blue-skinned god who is sitting and playing this instrument. Krishna is the central figure of the Bhagavad Gita, a famous Hindu scripture. He also appears in the writings of the Mahabharata as part of the battlefield and the conflict. In modern Hinduism, Krishna is an adored god, and his stories influenced other regions and religions too.
