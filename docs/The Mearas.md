# The Mearas

- The Mearas are known as the leaders of all horses, the best of the best. They are faster, stronger, more durable, and more intelligent than any other horse. In fact, they seemingly have slight supernatural abilities, as seen in The Two Towers, when Gandalf whistles, and Shadowfax appears, seemingly out of nowhere.
- Shadowfax is the 'Lord of all horses,' according to Gandalf, as he is a direct descendant of the most powerful horse to ever exist, Felarof. The Mearas are loyal, cunning, and infinitely brave, charging into combat whenever they are needed, even if the odds are stacked against them.
