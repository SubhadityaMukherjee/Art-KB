# An Electrifying Event

- In the early 1960s, (<https://mymodernmet.com/pop-art> "pop art") founder (<https://mymodernmet.com/andy-warhol-facts/)> pioneered silkscreen painting. Crafted using a combination of acrylic paint and the silkscreen method—a mechanical printmaking process in which the artist transferred paintings on canvas onto paper–these works allowed the artist to translate photographs as multiple, 'mass-produced' works.
- While Warhol's most famous silkscreen paintings feature popular celebrities and everyday objects as their subjects, his series took a darker turn in 1962, when he started his _Death and Disasters_ series. Featuring everything from devastating car accidents to poisonous cans of tuna to a _Big Electric Chair_ (a painting inspired by a press photograph from the prison where (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_and_Ethel_Rosenberg)> were executed), this collection of works speaks to Warhol's morbid interest in—and desensitization to— current events.
- 'When you see a gruesome picture over and over again,' the artist (<https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/warhol-electric-chair-t07145),> 'it doesn’t really have an effect.'
