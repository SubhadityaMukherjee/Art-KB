- Also known as Brunhild, Brünnhilde, Brynhild, Brynhildr is a valkyrie and a shieldmaiden in Norse and Germanic mythologies.

- Imprisoned in a castle on top of Mount Hindarfjall, Brynhildr got rescued by the hero of the Volsung saga Sigurdr Sigmundson after he killed the dragon Fafnir.
- The two fell in love and got married after Sigurdr proposed Brynhildr with the legendary ring Andvaranaut.
- On a side note, Brynhildr is known as the mother of Aslaug (Kraka), one of Ragnar Lothbrok’s wives.
