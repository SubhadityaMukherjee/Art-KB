# The Joy of Life by Jikken Kobo
- As many avant-garde movements emerged in '50s Japan, the Jikken Kobo group signaled an early late-20th century Japanese interest in multimedia and performance art. Their ballet, The Joy of Life, was the strongest incarnation of their presentation. Kobo created everything in the performance from the music to the backdrops to the lighting. The event functioned as a performative manifesto of the group's ideas and is seen as a necessary resuscitation of art culture in Japan following World War II.
