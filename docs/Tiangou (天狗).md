# Tiangou (天狗)
- Ancient Chinese believe that eclipses were the results of  
	the moon and sun being swallowed by a celestial dog known as 'Tiangou.'  
	Subsequently, the name was also used in Chinese astrology for comets that  
	would bring great misfortune. Note that although the Chinese characters for  
	Tiangou are the same as the Japanese Kanji for Tengu, the two mythical  
	creatures are totally different.
