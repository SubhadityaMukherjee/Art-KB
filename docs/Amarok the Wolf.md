# Amarok the Wolf

- Amarok, also known as Amaroq, is a giant wolf in Inuit mythology which was believed to kill people hunting alone.
- One of the few legends regarding Amarok suggests that a boy who was unable to move and disliked by his people prayed for the god of strength and Amarok came to his aid.
- Knocking the boy down with its tail, Amarok broke some bones in his body and told the boy that he could not move before because of those bones.
- The boy came to wrestle with Amarok daily and become so strong that he beat three bears and earned respect from his people.
- Although its origin is also linked to shunka warakin, hyaenodon and waheela, the myth of Amarok was most likely based on stories about direwolves told by ancient Eskimo people.
