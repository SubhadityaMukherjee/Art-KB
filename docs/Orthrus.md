# Orthrus

- Orthrus, also known as Orthus, was the two-headed hound that guarded the cattle of Geryon in Greek mythology.
- He was one of Echidna and Typhonâ€™s children (like Cerberus, the Lernean Hydra, Chimera and some other monsters in Greek myths) and was killed by Heracles while he was fulfilling the tenth of the twelve tasks/labors given to him by Eurystheus: capturing cattle of Geryon.
