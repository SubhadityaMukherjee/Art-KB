# Sutekh
- The Semitic name for the god Set (Seth) which the people known as the Hyksos introduced during the Second_Intermediate_Period (c. 1782-1570 BCE). The Hyksos identified Set with the warlike aspect of their god baal. Set was referred to as Sutekh through the reign of Ramesses_II (1279-1213 BCE) and invoked as a vanguard in war.
