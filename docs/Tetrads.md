# Tetrads
- Representations of completeness corresponding sometimes to the four cardinal points of the compass and best represented by the Four Sons of Horus. Balance was an important concept to the ancient Egyptians and the numbers two, four, and eight figure significantly in representations of the deities (as do three, six, and nine). Every male god has a female counterpart or a feminine aspect, the four goddesses Isis, Neith, [Nephthys](Nephthys.md), and Serket watch over the Four Sons of Horus, and the Ogdoad was the grouping of the eight gods of creative substances.
