# Biblical Revenge

- Artemisia Gentileschi, 'Judith Slaying Holofernes,' 1614–1620 (Photo: (<https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Judit_decapitando_a_Holofernes,_por_Artemisia_Gentileschi.jpg),> Public domain)
- The paintings of (<https://mymodernmet.com/baroque-period/)> painter (<https://mymodernmet.com/artemisia-gentileschi/)> are characterized by a deep color palette, skilled use of light and shadow, and, most prominently, an iconographic focus on suffering female figures seeking—and getting—revenge. A painting that typifies this approach is _Judith Slaying Holofernes_, a masterpiece inspired by a tale from the Old Testament that sees a vengeful widow decapitating a threatening man.
- When contextualized (within the context of the bible), Gentileschi's decision to portray the gory scene in graphic detail is not particularly unusual—especially for drama-loving (<https://mymodernmet.com/famous-baroque-artists/).> What sets _Judith Slaying Holofernes_ apart from other allegorical paintings of the period, however, is that Gentileschi most likely snuck a sneaky portrait into the grisly piece, as the slain Holofernes bears a striking resemblance to Agostino Tassi, a fellow Italian artist who raped Gentileschi when she was 17 years old.
