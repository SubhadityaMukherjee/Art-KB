# Neper
- God of the grains, son of the harvest goddess Renenutet. He was a personification of corn and associated with Osiris as a fertility god. Neper predates Osiris and may have been one of the earlier gods who prefigure the Osiris Myth. Coffin Text II.95 refers to him as the god "living after he has died" and inscriptions relate him with the Dying and Reviving God figure prior to Osiris' popularity.
