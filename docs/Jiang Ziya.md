# Jiang Ziya 
- Historically, Jiang Ziya was a noble who played a major role in the establishment of the Zhou Dynasty. In _Investiture of the Gods_, however, he was an elderly disciple of [Yuan Shi Tian Jun](Yuan%20Shi%20Tian%20Jun.md), the one who was dispatched to the mortal world to assist the Zhou Forces. Throughout the saga, he played the role of chief strategist, though he occasionally joined the battle too.
