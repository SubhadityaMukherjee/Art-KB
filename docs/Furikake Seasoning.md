# Furikake Seasoning
- Literally translating to "seven flavor chile pepper", this Japanese blend dates back to the 1600s and brings out the clean, simple flavors of Japanese cooking. Chiles & black peppercorns provide heat, while seaweed & orange peel add a complex flavor dimension. Pair with grilled meats, tempuras or sprinkle on top of rice or noodle dishes.
