# Fu Xi 
- Sometimes described as the ancient Chinese emperor-god, Fu Xi is often regarded as one of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, and credited with the invention of many, many things. For example, the _I Ching_ , which in turn heavily influenced Chinese concepts of the Yin and Yang. He is also said to be the brother and husband of Nüwa, and is often described as having a snake-like lower body. Lastly, together with Nüwa, Fu Xi created mankind. The couple did so by imbuing clay figures with magical life.
