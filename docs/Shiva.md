# Shiva

- Shiva is the god of destruction, the destroyer of evil, and the lord of meditation, time, and yoga. He is the supreme god of Shaivism, one of the major traditions of Hinduism. Furthermore, he is part of the Trimurti, and he is Parvatiâ€™s consort. From her, Shiva fathered Ganesha and Kartikeya.
- Just like the other gods of the Trimurti, Shiva has a myriad of avatars who deliver different functions on earth. His female counterpart varied and could also be or [Durga](Durga.md), depending on the myth. According to some legends, he brought the Ganges river to the world from the sky. In this sense, some of his depictions show him in or with the Ganges.
- Shiva commonly appears with three eyes, a trident, and a garland of skulls. He is typically depicted with a snake around his neck as well. As the supreme god of Shaivism, he is a highly worshipped god in modern Hinduism.
