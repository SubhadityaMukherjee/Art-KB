# Acephali

- Acephali were human-like creatures that were believed to have lived in Libya. Acephali had their faces on their chests because their heads were removed by gods as a result of a rebellion.
- Some were able to find their removed heads and carry them under their arms. The word acephali literally means 'without a head'.
- Also known as Acephalos, Acephalites, Akephalos and Akephale, these creatures were mentioned mostly in the works of Herodotus and Josephus.
