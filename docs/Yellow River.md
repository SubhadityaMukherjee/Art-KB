# Yellow River
- The Yellow River's basin was the birthplace of ancient Chinese
- There are frequent devastating Natural_disasters_in_China and course changes produced by the continual elevation of the River_bed sometimes above the level of its surrounding farm fields.
- One of its older Mongolian_language names was the "Black River",Yellow_River because the river runs clear before it enters the Loess_Plateau but the current name of the river among Inner_Mongoliais Ȟatan Gol . 
- Mongolia itself, it is simply called the Šar Mörön 
- In Qinghai the river's Standard_Tibetan name is "River of the Peacock"
- Among the deadliest were the 1344_Yellow_River_flood during the Yuan_dynasty the 1887_Yellow_River_flood during the Qing_dynasty which killed anywhere from 900,000 to 2 million people, and a Republic_of_China_era1931 flood (part of 1931_China_floods) that killed 1–4 million people.Yellow_River -12)
- The cause of the floods is the large amount of Fine-grained) Loess carried by the river from the Loess_Plateau which is continuously deposited along the bottom of its channel. The sedimentation causes natural dams to slowly accumulate. These subaqueous dams are unpredictable and generally undetectable. Eventually, the enormous amount of water needs to find a new way to the sea, forcing it to take the Path_of_least_resistance). When this happens, it bursts out across the flat North_China_Plain sometimes taking a new channel and inundating most farmland, cities or towns in its path. The traditional Chinese response of building higher and higher Leveealong the banks sometimes also contributed to the severity of the floods: When flood water did break through the levees, it could no longer drain back into the river bed as it would after a normal flood, as the river bed was sometimes now higher than the surrounding countryside. These changes could cause the river's mouth to shift as much as 480 km (300 mi sometimes reaching the ocean to the north of ShandongPeninsula and sometimes to the south. Yellow_River -Gascoigne-13)
- In Chinese_mythology the giant Kua_Fudrained the Yellow River and the Wei_Riverto quench his burning thirst as he pursued the Sun.Yellow_River -17)
- The river left these paths in 602 BC and shifted several hundred kilometers to the east.Yellow_River -Gernet_p59?-18)Yellow_River -20Sabotage of dikes, canals, and reservoirs and deliberate flooding of rival states became a standard military tactic during the Warring_States_period).Yellow_River -Floods-21As the Yellow River valley was the major entryway to the Guanzhongarea and the State_of_Qinfrom the North_China_Plain Qin heavily fortified the Hangu_Pass); it saw numerous battles and was also an important chokepoint protecting the Han_dynastycapitals of Chang%27anand Luoyang). Major flooding in AD 11 is credited with the downfall of the short-lived Xin_dynasty and another flood in AD 70 returned the river north of Shandong on essentially its present course.Yellow_River -Treg-15)
- From around the beginning of the 3rd century, the importance of the Hangu_Passwas reduced, with the major fortifications and military bases moved upriver to Tongguan_County). In AD 923, the desperate Later_Liang_(Five_Dynasties)general Duan_Ningagain broke the dikes, flooding 1,000 square miles (2,600 km2in a failed attempt to protect his realm's capital from the Later_Tang). A similar proposal from the Southern_Songengineer Li Chun concerning flooding the lower reaches of the river to protect the central plains from the Liao_dynastywas overruled in 1020: the Chanyuan_Treatybetween the two states had expressly forbidden the Song from establishing new moats or changing river courses.Yellow_River -Sedtime-22)
- On 9 June 1938, during the Second_Sino-Japanese_War Kuomintangtroops under Chiang_Kai-shek)1938_Yellow_River_floodholding back the river near the village of Huayuankou,_Henanin Henan, causing what has been called by Canadian historian, Diana Lary, a "war-induced natural disaster". The goal of the operation was to stop the advancing Japanese troops by following a strategy of "using water as a substitute for soldiers" (yishui daibing). The 1938_Yellow_River_floodof an area covering 54,000 km2 (20,800 sq mitook some 500,000 to 900,000 Chinese lives, along with an unknown number of Japanese soldiers. The flood prevented the Japanese Army from taking Zhengzhou on the southern bank of the Yellow River, but did not stop them from reaching their goal of capturing Wuhan which was the temporary seat of the Chinese government and straddles the Yangtze_River).Yellow_River -31)
