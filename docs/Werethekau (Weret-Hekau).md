# Werethekau (Weret-Hekau)
- An important protective goddess or, more often, an epithet applied to other female deities such as Isis. The name means "Great of Magic"and is associated with the uraeus and the crown of Lower Egypt. Wadjet is known as Weret-Hekau, as is Isis, but the name seems to have also designated a specific goddess of protection depicted as a rearing serpent although this could simply be Wadjet in her aggressive form.
