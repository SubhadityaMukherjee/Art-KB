# Al-mi’raj
- The third creature in our list of mythical creatures hails from the East. Al-mi’raj is a mythical creature in Islamic mythology which is basically a hare (rabbit) with a single horn on its forehead much like a unicorn.
- Al-mi’raj lived on a mysterious island named Jezîrat al-Tennyn within Indian Ocean.
- Despite its harmless appearance, this beast could kill creatures much larger than itself by stabbing them with its horn and then devour them.
- According to the belief, only a true witch could render Al-mi’raj harmless ensuring others to come close and carry the beast away.
