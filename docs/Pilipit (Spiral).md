# Pilipit (Spiral)
- the ancient Tagalogs swear their oaths to a statuette of a deity or monstrous beast, they called Pilipit, that would devour a perjurer. San Buenaventura (1613
- 369) describes the Pilipit as a devil figure
- a ceramic cat apparently made in China. The oath could also be taken on a substitute â€“ a snail bearing the same name, both having a twisted appearance. According to Francisco Colin, when the chiefs of Manila and Tondo swore allegiance to the Catholic sovereigns, in the year one thousand five hundred and seventy-one, they confirmed the peace agreements and the subjection with an oath, asking "the sun to pierce them through the middle, the crocodiles to eat them, and the women not to show them any favor or wish them well, if they broke their word." Sometimes they performed the pasambahan for greater solemnity and confirmation of the oath. That consisted in bringing forward the figure of some monstrous beast asking that they might be broken into pieces by it if they failed in their promise.
