# Penelope

# [[Penelope.md]]
- From the Greek word meaning “weaver,” this name gained notoriety through Homer’s epic poem, The Odyssey. In the masterpiece, Homer is married to Penelope. So, it’s little wonder that the name also means “faithful wife,” as it’s exactly what Penelope was to Homer during his long absence at Troy.
- This lovely name comes from the Greek word for “laurel” — and it comes with quite a story. Mythologically, it’s connected to a Naiad nymph named Daphne, the beautiful daughter of a river god. In addition to her beauty, she was known for being resolute in her conviction not to marry or be touched by a man in her lifetime. When the god Apollo relentlessly pursued her, she prayed to the river god, Peneus, to free her from Apollo’s affection. So, he used his powers of eternal youth and immortality to transform Daphne into a laurel tree.
