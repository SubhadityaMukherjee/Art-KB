# Nian (年)
- A horrific, man-eating monster that emerges from the mountains  
	every Chinese New Year to feast on villagers. It was eventually driven away  
	by the sound of firecrackers and the sight of red objects. The myth then  
	became the basis for several  
	(https

	with the Chinese character for Nian, also that for 'year.'
