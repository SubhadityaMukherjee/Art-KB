# Themyscira
- Themyscira has recently re-entered public consciousness as the home of Wonder Woman in the DCEU. However, the legend of the Amazonsâ€™ island nation has been around a lot longer than that superheroine. An enchanted city-state, Themyscira is a nation of fierce female warriors, visited in Greek mythology by Heracles, Theseus and Zeus, among others. Imaginings of this paradise have changed hugely over the ages, although the current depiction on the silver screen is an ancient-yet-futuristic, blue-watered wonderland.
