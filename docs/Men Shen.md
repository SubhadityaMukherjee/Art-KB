# Men Shen 
- The practice of protecting a household by placing images of Men Shen, or Door Gods, at the main entrance long existed in China. However, in the Tang Dynasty, [Emperor Taizong](https://owlcation.com/humanities/Top-10-Greatest-Chinese-Emperors) ordered the images of these Chinese gods to be those of his loyal generals Qin Shubao  and Yuchi Gong . This practice endured till today.
