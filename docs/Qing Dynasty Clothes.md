# Qing Dynasty Clothes
- At the Very Beginning, the Manchu Leader Required All the Han People to Wear the Manchus' Long Gown, or Cheongsam but This Restriction Loosened Soon Afterward.
- Some clothing of this era were really the result of laws imposed by Manchurian rulers of this Dynasty, such as the qípáo. (Under the broad Queue laws mandating that all male Chinese wear pony tails and shaved below the temples at least every ten days. (Disobedience was punishable by death.) It’s a one-piece Chinese dress for women; whereas the male version is called Changshan.  The tight fitting version known today was actually created in the 1920s in Shanghai and was made fashionable by socialites and upper-class women.
