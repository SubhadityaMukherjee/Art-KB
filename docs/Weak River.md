# Weak River
- The Weak River also known as the Weak Water or Ruoshui (Chinese_language):
- Literal_translation 'weak water' is an important feature in the mythical geography of Chinese literature, including novels and poetry over a course of over two millennia from the Warring_States_period to early Han_dynasty era poetry of the Chucionward. The Weak River is one of the mythological rivers flowing near Kunlun_(mythology home of a Western Paradise. The Weak River flowed with "water" so lacking in specific gravity that even a feather would not float, thus being a protective barrier against the unworthy, who otherwise would profane the paradise on Kunlun, and perhaps even climb up to Heaven and disturb the deities and other inhabitants residing there
