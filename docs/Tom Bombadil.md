# Tom Bombadil

- You might’ve noticed I’ve written the Ungoliant is the most powerful creature to ever exist in Tolkien’s lore, but still, it’s on the number two spot on the list. That’s because there is someone – or something – so mysterious, unknown, yet so powerful, that it has to be the number one spot on the list of the most powerful creatures in The Lord of the Rings universe.
- Nobody really knows what Tom Bombadil is, or what he’s capable of. In one moment, he appears as a bearded old man, living a quiet, peaceful, happy life in the Old Forest. In another moment, we learn that he could’ve destroyed the One Ring himself on a whim – he just didn’t care about the fight whatsoever.
- Tom wore the Ring, and it didn’t affect him in the slightest. He saw Frodo completely normally, even when the Hobbit wore the One Ring. Nobody knows the true extent of his powers.
- However, knowing he could’ve destroyed the One Ring himself when not even the flames of the almighty Ancalagon could do it, it’s safe to assume that he could probably destroy Sauron himself, and not even break a sweat. If only Tommy cared for anything but his peace, and his wife, Goldberry.
