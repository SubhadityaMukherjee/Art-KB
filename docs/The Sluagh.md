# The Sluagh

- Sluaghs were one of a handful of Irish mythical creatures that well and truly creeped me out as a child, after hearing stories about them from friends.
- These Celtic monsters were restless spirits that were said to be neither welcome in hell or heaven, so they were left to roam the lands.
- According to legend, the Sluaghs were angry about their fate and would snatch the soul of anyone with who they cross paths.
