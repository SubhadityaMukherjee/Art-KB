# Zerzura
- Somewhere in the vast Libyan desert to the west of the Nile – in the driest, most unforgiving wilderness imaginable – there’s said to be a Shining City. Zerzura is a white-washed oasis in the mode of ancient Egyptian cities. It proved especially alluring among Arabians during the early 20th century, when even nomads had no clear idea of how the Sahara fit together. The elusive dwelling – full of palm trees, wells, treasure, and a sleeping king and queen – is guarded by giants and boasts a gate with a striking bird carved into it.
