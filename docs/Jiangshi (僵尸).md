# Jiangshi (僵尸)
- English write-ups tend to translate Jiangshi as the  
	'Chinese vampire.' However, this hopping, paranormal creature is actually  
	more of a Chinese zombie. Nowadays always portrayed as a pallid corpse  
	dressed in Qing Dynasty imperial regalia, the most famous myth about the  
	Jiangshi is that of corpses being reanimated this way for easy  
	transportation to burial grounds or hometowns. In the 80s, thanks to the  
	success of the Hong Kong horror-comedy _Mr. Vampire_, East Asia was briefly  
	infatuated with this picture-perfect supernatural horror.
