# Sepa
- A protector god in the form of a centipede with the head of a donkey or horns, known as "The Centipede of Horus". He was worshipped as the deity who protected one from snake bites and some form of Sepa was venerated in the Predynastic Period (c. 6000-3150 BCE). He had his own temple at Heliopolis where he was associated with Osiris in a mummified form symbolizing his protective powers in the afterlife.
