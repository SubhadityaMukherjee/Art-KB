# Parade by Pablo Picasso & Ballet Russe
- Though there had been collaboration on ballets and operas previously, none had broken free of traditional notions of the forms quite like this group of artists did in the early 20th century. This was the first time Picasso and Satie worked on a ballet, or collaborated with one another at all, and the result was uncompromising to both contributors' outlooks. Not only did Picasso translate his Cubist perspective to costume design, but also Satie employed a number of unconventional instruments for a culturally disruptive and aggravating spectacle-it was one of many instances of modern art that caused the audience to riot.
