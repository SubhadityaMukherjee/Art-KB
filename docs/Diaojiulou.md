# Diaojiulou
- Diaojiaolou (literally means hanging attic) is a residential house with a dense architectural flavor of the ethnic minority in the southwestern Yunnan Province. The wooden building is built close to the mountain or above the river with an extended floor space. These houses are usually built on slopes with only support poles and no foundations, and are entirely made of wood without iron
