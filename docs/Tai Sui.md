# Tai Sui 
- [Tai Sui](https://owlcation.com/humanities/time-gods-goddesses) refers to the personified forms of the # stars opposite Jupiter during the latterâ€™s 12-year orbit. In Chinese astrology, each lunar year is always presided by one Tai Sui. Those with Chinese Zodiac signs opposing the reigning Tai Sui must then perform a worship ritual at the start of the new year to avoid misfortune.
