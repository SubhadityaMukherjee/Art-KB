# Quinon Sana (Kinunsánà)
- The name of the supreme deity among mountaineers (Boxer 2016
- 66/67). Schol. This is an -in-derivative of kunsánà, itself a kun# derivative of sánà "abundance". The prefix kun# is also found in wárì "opinion" < kunwárì "fake". is of the opinion that there must have existed native Tagalog terms, and that they disappeared from the language because they were taboo
- uttering them would have called the attention of the corresponding wrathful gods.
