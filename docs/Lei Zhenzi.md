# Lei Zhenzi 
- A half-brother of Zhou Wu Wang, Lei Zhenzi was transfigured into a hawkish being with wings and a beak after eating two magical almonds. An adept of weather magic, the winged deity then served under his half-sibling as a capable vanguard, earning several notable victories during the war. Some readers nowadays consider Lei Zhenziâ€™s image in the saga to be the appearance of Lei Gong, the Chinese mythological god of thunder.
