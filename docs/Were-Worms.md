# Were-Worms

- Now, it’s not even 100% clear if Were-Worms actually exist in Tolkien’s source material, or if they were mistaken for wingless dragons (which will also appear later on this list). Nevertheless, the Hobbits called the creatures Were-Worms, and they lived in the deserts east of the Shire. Peter Jackson included the beasts in The Hobbit and The Battle of Five Armies.
- Were-Worms looked like, well, giant worms, with maws so powerful they could plow through earth and stone as it were butter. They would certainly be among the most powerful, and most dangerous creatures in Middle-earth, but they hardly ever leave the underground and their tunnels, so the interaction between them and other species is very limited.
- Azog used them to dig tunnels between Erebor and Gundabad, but they were never really a part of the battle.
