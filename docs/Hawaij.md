# Hawaij
- This Yemeni spice blend comes in two varieties, hawaij for coffee and hawaij for soup. Hawaij for coffee includes freshly ground ginger, green cardamom, fennel and a handful of other warming spices. This blend is perfect for adding to ground coffee and, by extension, pairs well with any number of coffee-based baked goods, such as coffee cake or coffee donuts.
