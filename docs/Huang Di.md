# Huang Di
- The “Yellow Emperor” is one of the most significant icons in Chinese culture. One of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, he is credited with the invention of many things as well as venerated as the ancestor of the whole Chinese race. As for inventions, his most “important” creation is that of the Compass Chariot, which he supposedly used to defeat [Chi You](Chi%20You.md.md). Lastly, a good number of ancient texts were also attributed to him. For example, the _Huang Di Nei Jing_, an ancient Chinese medical thesis.
