# Jingwu (金乌)
- More famously known as the 'Three-legged Crow,' Jingwu, or  
	the Golden Crow, has long been associated with the sun in East Asian  
	cultures. In Chinese mythology, the ten suns that scorched the Earth during  
	Emperor Yao’s reign were all Golden Crows. All but one were later shot down  
	by the legendary archer, Hou Yi.
