# Cinnamon
- Vietnamese cinnamon is globally renowned for its high oil content and strong, spicy flavor. Most known in the US as a perfect complement to baked goods like apple pie, cakes, muffins and cinnamon rolls, we also love this cinnamon paired with chiles. Or infuse in your morning coffee or added to roasted pumpkin and squash soup.
