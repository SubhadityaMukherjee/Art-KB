# Yanluo Wang 
- Yanluo Wang is the transliteration of the Vedic name “Yama,” and is the generic title used in Chinese conversations to refer to the [King of Hell](https://owlcation.com/humanities/chinese-gods-of-hell), or the Chinese God of Death. In the Ten Courts version of Chinese Hell, though, Yan Luo Wang specifically refers to the judge presiding over the fifth court. Some Chinese folktales further claim that Yan Luo Wang is none other than [[Bao Zheng.md]] (see above).
