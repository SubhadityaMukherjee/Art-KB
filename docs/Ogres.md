# Ogres

- Ogres are about as equally as powerful as Trolls, but I’ve put them one spot above for a couple of reasons. First of all, they are – or at least seem to be – a bit more intelligent than Trolls. Second of all, they are solid warriors. And third, they don’t have the sunlight weakness – they won’t get turned into stone during daytime.
- That being said, ogres are much smaller than their Troll brethren. Don’t get me wrong; they are bigger than Orcs and tougher to kill. They just don’t grow 50-feet tall. We’ve seen some Ogres in The Hobbit trilogy. Azog and Bolg used them more often than Trolls, as they moved faster and didn’t mind some tanning.
