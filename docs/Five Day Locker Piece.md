# Five Day Locker Piece
- was a 1971 performance by Chris Burden in which he entered a student locker for five days as part of his UC Irvine Master's thesis.
- For his UC Irvine Master of Fine Arts thesis, performance artist Chris Burden entered an art building student locker (2x2x3 feet) for five days, from April 26â€“30, 1971. He had some room to wiggle but not unbend. In the lockers above and below him, Burden put a five-gallon water container and an empty container for urine with hoses for each. He fasted for several days in advance and consulted with doctors, who warned of potential blood clots and paralysis.
- Outside the locker, students and teachers argued about the project's merits. The campus police considered ending the performance early for Burden's safety. Towards the end, Burden said, the dean's office heard about the performance and considered ending it in light of their responsibility but ultimately decided to let it finish. Near the end, Burden himself began to fear his vulnerability and what a crazed person could do to him.
