# Ryūgū-jō (Dragon Palace)
- In a Japanese folktale, a fisherman rescues a turtle from a group of mean-spirited kids; his reward is a trip to the underwater Dragon Palace, or Ryūgū-jō. By holding onto the turtle’s back, he reaches a royal mansion made of red and white coral, or crystal (depending on who’s telling the story). The home of the Dragon King and the beautiful Dragon Princess, it has a different season on each side. Springtime cherry blossoms are visible from the east windows, with summertime sunflowers to the south. To get a glimpse of the aquatic splendour that the Ryūgū-jō holds, the Japanese believe that you have to find a rare Rumphius’ slit shell and look inside.
