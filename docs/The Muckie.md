# The Muckie

- The Muckie was a mysterious Irish mythical creature that’s said to inhabit the Lakes of Killarney in Ireland, earning it comparisons with Scotland’s Lough Ness Monster.
- Interetingly enough, back in 2003 scientists conducted a number of scans using sonar technology to understand more about the lakes fish population.
- However, eerily, the sonar encountered a large solid mass, which has fuelled speculation that the lake is inhabited by one of the last remaining Celtic mythological creatures.
