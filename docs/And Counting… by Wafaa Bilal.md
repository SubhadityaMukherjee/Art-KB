# And Counting… by Wafaa Bilal
- Wafaa Bilal’s brother Haji was killed by a missile in their hometown Kufa, Iraq. Bilal felt that the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis like his brother were invisible to Americans, so in a 24-hour live performance Bilal had his back tattooed to bring awareness to their deaths. Over a borderless map of Iraq, one dot was placed for each Iraqi and American war casualty. Bilal had 5,000 American soldiers represented by red dots and 100,000 Iraqi casualties represented by dots in green UV ink, invisible until shown under a blacklight. During the performance the names of the dead were read off. Bilal asked visitors to donate $1 to fund scholarships for Americans and Iraqis who lost parents in the war.
