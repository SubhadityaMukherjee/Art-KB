# [Athena](Athena.md)
- Athena is one of [Zeus](Zeus.md)â€™ daughters, born without a mother, and maybe even his favorite kid, which means she had a ton of power. She is known as a goddess of war, but also of wisdom and reason. Unlike other Greek gods, her story is based on financial dealings and being in the city, making big decisions alongside her father, which makes it a particularly feminist name if you want to read it that way. In Roman mythology, she is known as the goddess Minerva.
