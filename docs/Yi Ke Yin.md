# Yi Ke Yin
- In southern China 's Kunming , Yunnan Province, there is a variation of Siheyuan.
- Here the courtyard compounds are called YikeYin, which is Chinese for “seal” because when viewed from above the layout resembles the familiar shape of the square seal to be seen on Chinese documents and paintings.
