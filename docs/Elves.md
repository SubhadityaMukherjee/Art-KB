# Elves

- Elves are a gifted humanoid species that have been granted immortal life by the Valar for their goodness, loyalty, and help in the battle against Melkor, aka Morgoth, the initial Dark Lord, and Sauron’s boss. In the Third Age, they lived almost exclusively in Rivendell, but before, their land was called Eldamar.
- Elrond, Arwen’s father, was their leader before they took the ships to the Immortal Lands. The most famous Elf among The Lord of the Rings fans is Legolas. Elves are gifted with incredible sight, and hearing which works almost like a sixth sense. Their gifts make them incredibly precise, creating the perfect foundation for the Elves to become Middle-earth’s greatest archers.
