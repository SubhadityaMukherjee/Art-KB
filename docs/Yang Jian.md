# Yang Jian
- One of the most powerful warriors of the Zhou Forces, Yang Jian was based on Erlang Shen, a widely worshiped deity in Taoism. His defining feature is that of a third “heavenly eye” on his forehead. Capable of a vast variety of supernatural abilities and assisted by a heavenly hound, Yang Jian was near undefeatable throughout the saga too. In _Journey to the West,_ Yang Jian famously fought [Sun Wukong](Sun%20Wukong.md.md). He was furthermore the only warrior god from the Jade Emperor’s pantheon able to battle the Monkey King to a standstill.
