# The Oilliphéist

- Although you’ll often hear the Oilliphéist described as a Celtic monster, it was said to take on the appearance of a dragon.
- The Oilliphéist used to inhabit the dark, murky waters of many lakes and rivers across Ireland and many Irish warriors ended up fighting these Celtic folklore creatures.
