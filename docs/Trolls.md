# Trolls

- Trolls are also creatures that were initially created by the forces of evil, although they didn’t turn out as planned, per se. They aren’t really intelligent, but they are huge, with the largest of the species reaching up to 50 feet (around 15 meters). We’ve seen the three Troll brothers in The Hobbit movie, trying to earth the Dwarves and Bilbo Baggins.
- Luckily, Bilbo knew about their one major weakness. When Trolls are exposed to sunlight, they turn into stone. Sauron tends to use Trolls as power punchers, door breakers, or equipment carriers, but only when it’s nighttime, due to their particular weakness. If you see a Troll out on the battlefield when it’s daytime, it’s not a Troll anymore. More on that later, though.
