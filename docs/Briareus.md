# Briareus

- Here comes the first of Greek monsters in our mythical creatures list. Also known as Aegaeon, Briareus is one of the Hecatoncheires in Greek mythology born from [Uranus](Uranus.md) and Gaia. Briareus, the son of these major deities representing Heaven and Earth, had 100 arms and 50 heads.
- The word Hecatoncheires is actually derived from Greek words meanings 'hundred hands' although some accounts suggest the word _briaeros_ simply means strong.
- Some accounts (by Homer and Hesiod) suggest that Briareus and his brothers helped [Zeus](Zeus.md) while he was battling Titans.
- On the other hand, some accounts (Hymn to Delos by Callimachus) have Briareus as an enemy of [Zeus](Zeus.md) who was buried under Mount Etna after he was defeated and killed.
- Another account refers to him as the god of sea-storms who wed Kymopoleia, one of Poseidonâ€™s daughters. This is the reason he is identified as Aegeon/Aegion (which means something like 'of the Aegean Sea')
