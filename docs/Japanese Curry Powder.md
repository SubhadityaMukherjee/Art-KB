# Japanese Curry Powder
- Japanese curry powder, or 'kare raisu', is known today as a thick stew of potatoes, carrots, onions, and either beef, chicken or seafood, served over rice and topped with pickles. Curry was introduced to Japan by the British in the mid 19th century, when India was under colonial British rule, and was originally considered to be Western cuisine. Japanese curry has since been adapted since its introduction to Japan, and is so widely consumed that it can be called a national dish.
