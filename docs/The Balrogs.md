# The Balrogs

- Believe it or not, the almighty Balrogs aren’t the most powerful creatures Tolkien has created, although they are right up there. So, Balrogs were actually Maiar, just like Gandalf and other wizards – they were angelic beings created by the Valar to keep the balance between good and evil intact.
- However, some Maiar were corrupted by Morgoth, turning them from angels to demons. By the time the War of the Ring took place, there were very few Balrogs left, but one was lurking in the Mines of Moria. Durin’s Bane, the Balrog Gandalf fought in the Fellowship of the Ring, got his name from slaying the infamous Dwarven king.
- The demon slept for years in the depths of Moria, but the Dwarves were greedy and dug too deep, awakening the beast that Gandalf ultimately barely defeated. Despite Durin’s Bane’s incredible might, there were Balrogs that could eat him for breakfast.
