# Meng Jiang Nü 
- The story goes that Lady Meng Jiang’s husband was conscripted by the Qin Dynasty to build the Great Wall of China. After receiving no news of him for years, Meng Jiang set off to find him. At a site, she learned that her husband has died and in her grief, she was inconsolable and wept miserably. The sound of her sobs then brought down a portion of the unfinished wall, revealing her husband’s bones. In modern times, the folktale has been reinterpreted as a metaphor for the struggle against tyrannical rule.
