# The Hanging Gardens of Babylon
- Of all the enchanting places on this list, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon’s existence is the one in which people have put the most stock. After all, Herodotus categorised it as one of his Seven Wonders of the World.
- However, numerous digs around the suspected location near the royal palace of Babylon have left archaeologists empty-handed time and again, sowing doubt as to whether it was anything more than a story. Historians haven’t given up the fight just yet though, considering other locations and other forms the gardens might have taken: for example, a collection of gorgeous rooftop gardens. However, until these theories are grounded in evidence, the Hanging Gardens must be consigned to fiction.
