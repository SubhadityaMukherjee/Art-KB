# The Fairy Queen

- You can’t talk about Irish mythological creatures without mentioning the fairies. And you can’t mention the fairies without first introducing the fairy queen.
- The ruler of all fairies, the Fairy Queen is one of the most famous Celtic creatures. Often named Titanian or Mab, she is often described as both seductive and beautiful.
