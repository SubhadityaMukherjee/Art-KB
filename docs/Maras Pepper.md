# Maras Pepper
- These Turkish Marash pepper flakes sit right next to the salt and pepper in much of Turkey and the Mediterranean. And chefs in some of the world's most famous restaurants use these crushed chili pepper flakes for a fruity, earthy, medium heat. Add at the end to give a nice pop of heat to spicy tomato sauces, lamb and chicken rubs or as a bread dip mixed with olive oil.
