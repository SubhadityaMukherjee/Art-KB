# The Bodach

- Although similar to the boogeyman in appearance, the Bodach is one of a number of Celtic mythological creatures who, according to legend, was completely harmless.
- Some tales describe the Bodach as a Celtic creature that plays tricks on kids. Others, in Scottish folklore, say he used to capture bold children (a story used to scare kids into behaving).
