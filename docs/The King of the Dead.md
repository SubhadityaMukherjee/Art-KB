# The King of the Dead

- There was this group of Men who promised the King of Gondor help in a fight against the Dark Lord. However, instead of helping, they were cowards, who abandoned Gondor and the King, and fled into the mountains, where they lived in exile, and eventually died. They were cursed, never to rest until they fulfilled their oath to the King of Gondor.
- Aragorn went into the dreadful mountains to get them to fulfill their oath, and although they wanted to deny him at first, Aragorn got the King of the Dead to agree, answering to the King of Gondor. They helped during the Siege of Minas Tirith, swarming Sauron’s armies and taking them down like they were nothing. After the battle, Aragorn released them of their curse.
- The King of the Dead and his army are so high on this list because they are among the most powerful beings ever to fight in any of the wars of Middle-earth. First, you can’t hurt them, as they are already dead. Second, they’re ghosts, so they can pass through anything and just decimate until there’s nothing – or no one – left to kill.
