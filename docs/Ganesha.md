# Ganesha

- was the son of Shiva and Parvati, and he was the god of success, wisdom, and new beginnings. Ganesha was also the remover of obstacles and the lord of knowledge. All branches of Hinduism worship Ganesha, and this makes him among the most influential deity of this religion.
- In most of his depictions, he appears as a pot-bellied elephant. The image of Ganesha with his elephant head is one of the most spread images of India. In some of his depictions, Ganesha appears riding a mouse, which helps him remove the barriers to success. Ganesha is also the Lord of the People, as his name proposes. Since he is the god of beginnings, he is a central part of the rites and adorations in modern Hinduism.
