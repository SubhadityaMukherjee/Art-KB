# Pink Peppercorns
- Originating in Latin America, these pink peppercorns have a peppery bite with a sweet, fruity flavor and had a heavy influence on Peruvian cuisine. Weâ€™ve included pink Himalayan sea salt to this blend, which pairs perfectly when sprinkled lightly on sweet dishes like ice cream, melons or chocolate or light, savory dishes such as scallops or salmon.
