# Madras Curry Powder
- Originating in Chennai, Madras curry powder is an earthier, milder version of other curry powders with a turmeric base, cassia, and fenugreek for an earthy sweetness, plus Kashmiri chiles for heat. Salt free, we love this salt free curry powder in slow-cooked lentils, dahls and vegetable curries or sprinkle onto curried potato salad or tuna salad for a kick.
