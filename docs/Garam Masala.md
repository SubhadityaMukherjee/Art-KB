# Garam Masala
- Among the most famous of Indian masalas, there are literally thousands of ways to prepare garam masala. Our organic garam masala is toasted and freshly ground, using a traditional Punjabi family recipe. A great addition to your recipe as it gives complex flavor and heat to chicken tikka masala (a British invention), traditional curries, braised vegetables or lentils.
