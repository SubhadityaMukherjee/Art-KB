# Gamhanan
- the supreme deity and giver of life, security, and livelihood
- lives with many other gods in Mount Daeogdog, where he gives life and punishes errant mortals
- used to have a loyal deer-like pet and messenger called Panigotlo, which bleated as a sign of abundance to mortals or foretells floods and despairs to alert the people
