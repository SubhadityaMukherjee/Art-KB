# Agartha
- A mythic world connected to Buddhist belief and, supposedly, hiding in the core of the Earth, Agartha is said to house a superb, wise civilisation. Theories of different possible access points to this tranquil, subterranean continent abound, from the South and North Poles to the Himalayan mountains â€“ to the Mammoth Cave in Kentucky.
