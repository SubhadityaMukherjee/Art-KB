# Scylla

- Scylla was a monster in Greek mythology that lived between two rocks near Italy and Sicily.
- The creature was described by Homer as a monster with twelve feet and six long necks. It had six heads with three rows of sharp teeth.
- While some myths suggest Crataeis was Scylla’s mother, Hecate was also linked to be the mother in some other myths. There is no obvious mention of its father but Apollodorus suggested either Tyrrhenus or Phorcys was the father of Scylla.
- In Homer’s _Odyssey_, Circe tells Odysseus to sail close to Scylla rather than Charybdis, Scylla’s counterpart that swallowed the sea waters three times a day.
- Circe suggests Odysseus that Charybdis might sink his ship as a whole while Scylla will only take six of his men (if he asks Crataeis, Scylla’s mother to make her offspring to attack his ship only once).
- Odysseus listens to Circe and loses six of his men to Scylla while passing through.
