# Nezha 
- The most famous protagonist of the saga and one of the most beloved Chinese mythological characters in Chinese culture, Nezha was the impetuous third son of Shang General [[Li Jing.md]]. He was also the reincarnation of a divine spirit and was born after his mother bore him for # months. After many fracases with his father and other supernatural characters, Nezha committed suicide but was resurrected using a lotus-made body. Thereafter, he gained a slew of new abilities and weapons, also joining the Zhou Forces with his father. Today, Nezha, or the “Third Prince,” is one of the most venerated Taoist deities in Taiwan.
