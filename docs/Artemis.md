# Artemis

# [[Artemis.md]]
- Artemis was supposed to be the daughter of [[Zeus.md]] and one of his mistresses, Leto, as well as the twin sister of Apollo. Known as Diana in Roman mythology, she is the goddess of hunting and wild animals. This has led to the name being gender-neutral in modern-day Greek, meaning “butcher.”
