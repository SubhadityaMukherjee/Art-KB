# Separation by Petr Pavlensky
- In 2014, Pavlensky took another symbolic stand against the Russian government. As a protest of the use of forced psychiatric treatment to achieve political goals, Pavlensky climbed up onto the roof of Moscow’s psychiatric center fully naked and cut his left earlobe off with a large knife. Pavlensky, with blood rushing down his body, was quickly removed by police. Moscow’s psychiatric center was infamous for diagnosing dissidents in the USSR on highly questionable grounds. Pavlensky himself has been sought after by prosecutors to undergo psychiatric evaluation for his previous cases of vandalism.
