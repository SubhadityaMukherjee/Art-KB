# Shen Nong
- The “Divine Farmer” was an ancient Chinese leader credited with the development of medicine and agriculture. Legend goes that he tested hundreds of herbs by ingesting them himself, ultimately dying when he ate the extremely toxic “intestine rupturing [grass](docs/Grass.md).” Sometimes considered as one of Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, historians now believe Shen Nong was actually Yan Di , the latter also a mythical ancient Chinese ruler. Other versions describe Shen Nong as the original lord of [Chi You](Chi%20You.md.md), thus making him an indirect opponent of Huang Di.
