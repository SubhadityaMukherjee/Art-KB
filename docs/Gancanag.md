# Gancanag

- The Gancanagh is another strange one, and arguably falls into the ‘Celtic monsters’ category, thanks to how his victims end up.
- The Gancanagh was known to seduce both men and women with what were said to be addictive toxins that emitted a powerful, alluring scent.
- However, all wasn’t as it seemed. Those that fell victim to his seductive charm ended up passing away not long after.
