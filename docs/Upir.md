# Upir

- Upir is the word used to describe vampires in Slavic cultures although there are some slight difference between the myth regarding upirs and vampires.
- As one of those differences, upirs had the ability to walk during the day and did not burn unlike vampires.
- There were different opinions as to how an upir could be killed. According to the belief, staking an upir in the heart with a blessed stake would kill the creature while some other people suggested staking in the heart while sinking them in holy water was the way to kill upirs.
- Decapitation and incineration were mentioned in the stories as other ways of killing upirs. If you would like to read more about the myth regarding this mythical creature, (<https://mythologian.net/what-is-an-upir/).>
