# Aeolus (aka Aeolos, Aiolos, Aiolus, Eolus) 
- God and keeper of the winds.
- Aeolus was the lord of the winds and the king of the rocky floating island of Aeolia.
- Odysseus and his crew visited the island during his famous odyssey home to Ithaca. Aeolus gave a bag to Odysseus which contained all of the storm-winds to ensure their safe voyage home. While sailing away his crew were overcome by curiosity, thinking the bag must have contained treasures. After they opened the bag, the strong winds escaped, which blew them back to the same isle.
