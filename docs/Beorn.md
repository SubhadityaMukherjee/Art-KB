# Beorn

- Beorn was a man who had the ability to transform into a huge, mighty bear that struck fear into the bones of entire Orc squadrons. The official name for such a creature – or person, if you will – is a skin-changer.
- Beorn had incredible strength, speed, and agility, much more powerful than the average bear despite his colossal size. He is above Azog and Bolg on the list because he was the one to destroy Bolg after walking through his entire Orc army like it was butter.
- Beorn hates Wargs, Orcs, and Goblins, but has a deep respect for all other creatures of Middle-earth, despite being a loner and preferring life in isolation.
