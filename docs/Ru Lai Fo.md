# Ru Lai Fo 
- In modern Chinese popular entertainment, Ru Lai Fo typically refers to Gautama Buddha, even though “Ru Lai” simply means Buddha and could be any of the other enlightened beings in the Buddhist universe. This practice began with _Journey to the West_, in which Gautama Buddha was named as such.
