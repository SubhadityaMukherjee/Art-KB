# Hou (犼)
- Also known as Denglong, Hou is a Chinese legendary creature said  
	to be one of the sons of the Dragon King. It symbolizes the mandate of  
	heaven and is described as resembling a deer but with the characteristics  
	of many other animals. Today, four statues of Hou still stand at the top of  
	Beijing’s Tiananmen Gate. Legend goes that the ones facing south i.e. away  
	from the Forbidden City will roar if the emperor does not return from an  
	expedition. In contrast, the ones facing north will howl if the presiding  
	emperor is decadent and useless. The northward howls are declarations that  
	the decadent emperor should leave the Forbidden City i.e. abdicate.
