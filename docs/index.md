# Art Research
- Most of the articles here are about other things. Gods, stories, folklore, performances. Anything I find relevant.
- In time there might be random things that I find worth noting down.

## Warning
- I research a lot of random things. Sometimes they are pretty horrifying. I bear no responsibility if you feel crap seeing them. So do I. I sincerely hate all of them and the people responsible for this cruelty. But I also think that unless I know about them, I will not be able to truly understand human nature.
- All the information here is from the internet. Therefore I hold no claims of truth or validity.
