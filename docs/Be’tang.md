# Be’tang
- unpredictable shape-shifting spirit-creatures living in the forests or wilderness called Gongot
- youth and softness are their properties, while they can also alter a human's sense of time
- they may take the form of a white dog, a large deer, a horse with a hanging tongue, a naked woman, or beings with grotesque shapes, whose attributes range from long arms and legs, small heads, oversized feet, fur bodies, to hairless bodies
- they may also enter a person's dreams or paralyze a human
