# Jiutou Niao (九头鸟)
- Jiutou Niao means 'Nine-Headed Bird' and in Ancient  
	China, it was worshipped by the ancestors of the Warring State of Chu till  
	demonized by the cultural dominance of the reigning Zhou Dynasty. In  
	subsequent centuries, the legendary bird’s unnatural appearance further led  
	to it being associated with disasters, to the extent it was given the  
	alternate name of Gui Che (鬼车, ghostly vehicle). Some folktales  
	additionally state that the Jiutou Niao will suck away the life force of  
	children. On seeing it, all lights must be extinguished and hounds released  
	to banish the evil creature.
