# Álfheimr
- According to Norse mythology, Álfheimr is where the light-elves live, way up in the highest echelons of the world. It’s part of the Nine Worlds that comprise the universe. While some are burning hot places overflowing with lava or permanently clouded in mist, Álfheimr is a fertile place filled with the light and warmth. The elves are gracious demigods, described in the 12th century as 'fairer to look upon than the sun'.
