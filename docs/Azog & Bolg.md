# Azog & Bolg

- Azog the Defiler was the pale, scarred Orc captain that we saw hunt down Thorin, Bilbo, and the Dwarves in the Hobbit. Heâ€™s recognizable for the scratch marks across the body and face, as well as an arm replaced with a metal spike. Bolg was his son, who was also an Orc captain.
- Although Azog was probably physically stronger, Bolg surpassed his father in several categories, especially strategy and army-leading, as well as one-on-one combat. Still, Azog was more intimidating, if you ask me. I chose to put them above other Orcs, including the Uruk-hai, as they presented better cognitive capabilities and incredible combat skills.
