# Tír Na nÓg
- A particularly alluring vision in Celtic mythology is the supernatural land of Tír na nÓg (The Land of Ever Young). With an alleged location off the west coast of Ireland, this place – where five days equal three earthly years – is only ever seen by a lucky few. The trees, flowers and hills of this lush dwelling remain green year-round; no wonder the inhabitants never feel sad. It’s also said to home the Tuatha Dé Danann: a mythic Celtic people believed believe to have evolved into the Fae or Fairies that Ireland is so fond of. You’ll need their invitation to live with them in Tír na nÓg; once you get it, you can join them in drinking from crystal glasses and listening to the plucking of golden harps
