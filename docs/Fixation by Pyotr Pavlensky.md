# Fixation by Pyotr Pavlensky
- Russian protest artist Pyotr (or Petr) Pavlensky has used extreme performance art to bring attention to corruption in the Russian government and of his qualms with Russian society. In one of his most extreme ‘living pain’ performances, Pavlensky stripped his clothes off and nailed his scrotum to the floor of the Red Square, a central city square in Moscow, and he remained there for an hour and a half. He said this performance was ‘a metaphor for the apathy, political indifference, and fatalism of modern Russian society.’ His other works of protest have included sewing his mouth shut and setting the wooden doors of the former Soviet security agency office on fire.
