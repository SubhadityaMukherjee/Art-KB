# Ungoliant

- The Ungoliant is the most powerful creature to ever exist. The incredibly mighty giant spider that Frodo encountered – Shelob – is a direct descendant of the Ungoliant. However, when it comes to size, power, bloodlust, or hunger, Shelob is nowhere near the mother of spiders.
- The Ungoliant is not just a typical giant spider. It’s speculated that it’s a creature made out of pure darkness, with incredible, insatiable hunger, and light as her favorite food source. The Ungoliant was so hungry that she was easily manipulated with 'food,' which is essentially how Melkor used the spider to devour the Two Trees of Valinor.
- Even after that, the Ungoliant lived for nothing than feasting endlessly. I don’t think anybody could ever kill the creature, until one day, the hunger became so insatiable that the Ungoliant literally devoured itself.
