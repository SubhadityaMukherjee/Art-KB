# Kali

- is the Hindu goddess of destruction, war, violence, and time. Some of her depictions show her with her skin completely black or intense blue. She was a mighty goddess who had a terrifying appearance. Most artworks show Kali standing on her husband, Shiva, while holding a decapitated head in one of her hands. She appears in most depictions with a skirt of severed human arms and a necklace of severed heads.
- Kali was a ruthless goddess who represented violence and death. Due to her uncontrollable actions and her role as an all-powerful woman, she became a symbol of feminism from the 20th century onwards.
