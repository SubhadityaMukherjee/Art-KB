# Advieh
- This warming, Persian inspired advieh spice blend is crafted with black peppercorns, toasted cumin, ground lime, nutmeg, and rose petals. Resulting in subtly layered and complex flavors. Not too sweet and not too spicy, this classic blend is meant for meat or bean khoresht (Persian stews). Stir through rice or couscous or blend with oil or yogurt to create a rub for kabobs or grilled or roasted vegetables.
