# Goblins

- Many fans of The Lord of the Rings think that Goblins and Orcs are the same thing. However, that’s not really true. While they are 'related' to Orcs – being created for various evil purposes, the two species are actually separate. Orcs have several sub-species among themselves (like the intelligent Uruk-hai), and so do Goblins.
- Goblins are usually smaller, thinner, and have pointier extremities. One might say that Orcs somewhat resemble humans more, whereas Goblins resemble Elves more. Goblins are also smarter than common Orcs and have an affinity towards technology, engineering, developing weaponry, etc.
- While they are usually quite small, the Goblin King was a huge creature (the under chin guy who trapped Thorin and the Dwarves in The Hobbit., albeit not that powerful due to his fat, inert body.
- I’d like to point out that Tolkien sometimes used the terms Orcs and Goblins interchangeably, so Goblins can be considered as a sub-species to the Orcs, but Peter Jackon’s films made a distinct separation between the species.
