# Da Ji 
- The human avatar of a nine-tailed fox, Da Ji was dispatched by Nüwa to bewitch [Di Xin](https://owlcation.com/humanities/Top-10-Terrible-Chinese-Emperors) i.e. the final Shang Emperor, after the latter insulted the goddess in her own temple. The story goes that Da Ji then got carried away and created great suffering in China with her many vile acts. Xu Zhonglin based Da Ji on a “real-life” consort of the historical Di Xin, one said to be just as wicked.
