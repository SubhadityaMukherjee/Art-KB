# Avalon
- In Arthurian legend and Celtic myth, Avalon (the Isle of Apples) was considered the ultimate safe haven. After first extracting his sword Excalibur on the island as a young lad, this is where King Arthur was nourished back to health after his near-lethal battle with Mordred. In the earliest sources, itâ€™s described as a land of plenty, where wild apple trees and vineyards grow of their own accord no matter what the season and British knights gather around their king to live in peace.
