# Li Jing 
- Originally a high-ranking Shang officer, Li Jing defected to the Zhou forces and became one of Zhou Wu Wang’s leading generals. His greatest joy in life, and burden, was his rebellious third son [[Nezha.md]], with whom he once severed all relationships with. To control [[Nezha.md]], Li was thereafter given a [magical pagoda](https://owlcation.com/humanities/chinese-legendary-artifacts), one that could instantly imprison most beings. Readers familiar with other Asian mythologies will immediately notice Li’s resemblance to the Japanese Buddhist Guardian Bishamon. Li Jing is also often referred to with his epithet of “Pagoda Bearing Heavenly King.”
