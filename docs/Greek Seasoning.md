# Greek Seasoning
- Packed with Greek oregano, lemon peel, thyme, freshly ground Tellicherry peppercorns and a very light touch of nutmeg and cinnamon. This light and tangy salt-free Greek seasoning work perfectly for a homemade gyro sauce, chicken dry rub, Greek shish kebabs, baked potato fries, lemon, and olive oil dressing or in olive oil with grilled veggies.
