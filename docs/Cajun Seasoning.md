# Cajun Seasoning
- This freshly ground cajun seasoning is your foundation for any flavorful, Cajun-inspired recipe. We love the flavors of this southern Louisiana spice blend, especially in the summer. Use to create maque choux (Cajun succotash), Cajun pasta and sausage, Cajun shrimp & grits, Cajun dipping sauce or as a flavor burst on popcorn.
