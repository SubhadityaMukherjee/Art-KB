# Chinese Taoist Architecture
- It applies two architectural styles - traditional style and Bagua style. In the former style, traditional symmetric architectural layout is applied.
- Main halls are set up on the central axis.
- The second is the Bagua style in which all structures surround the Danlu in the center.
- The center axis from the south to the north is very long and structures flank the axis.
- The style reflects Taoist philosophy that the human cosmos follows the natural cosmos to integrate energy, qi and spirit.
