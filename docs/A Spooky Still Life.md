# A Spooky Still Life

- Modern art master (<https://mymodernmet.com/paul-cezanne-paintings/)> painted _Pyramid of Skulls_ at the turn of the century. Featuring only a stack of human skulls as its subject, this piece offers an ominous alternative to the artist's more traditional (<https://mymodernmet.com/what-is-still-life-painting-definition/)> paintings of fruits and bottles.
- While such eerie iconography was not typical of (<https://mymodernmet.com/post-impressionism/),> artists had been incorporating skulls and other symbols of mortality into arrangements of objects since ancient times. Defined as (<https://mymodernmet.com/memento-mori-art/),> a Latin title that translates to 'remember that you have to die,' this genre of painting focuses on the fleeting nature of life.
- As he approached old age, Cézanne became increasingly fascinated by death. From 1898 until the end of his life in 1905, Cézanne painted several still lifes of skulls. While most of these depictions do not focus solely on the skeletal objects, _Pyramid of Skulls_ places them at the forefront, forcing the viewer to confront them and, consequently, reflect upon death. 'These bony visages all but assault the viewer,' art historian Françoise Cachin said, 'displaying an assertiveness very much at odds with the usual reserve of domestic still life tableaux.'
