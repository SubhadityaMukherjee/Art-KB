# Tang Sanzang 
- More famously known as Tripitaka to the Western World, Tang Sanzang was based on Xuan Zang, a real-life Tang Dynasty Monk who went on a pilgrimage to India to collect Buddhist sutras. In _Journey to the West_, he was [Sun Wukong](Sun%20Wukong.md.md)’s second master. He was also consistently portrayed by author Wu Cheng’en as naïve, hapless, and excessively benevolent.
