# [[Hestia.md|Hestia]] (Roman Name Vesta)
- Goddess of the hearth and home.
- Hestia is a lovely name for a girl, as she is known for being the goddess of home and hearth. But not because she is a homebody â€” rather, [[Zeus.md]] put Hestia, known as Vestia in Roman mythology, in charge of tending the fires where people cooked or made sacrifices, so she received a share of each one people made. Not a bad gig, to be honest.
