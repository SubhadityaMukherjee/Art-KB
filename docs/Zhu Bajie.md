# Zhu Bajie 
- The comic relief of the saga, pig-faced Bajie was greedy, lascivious, lazy, and terribly jealous of [Sun Wukong](Sun%20Wukong.md). Formerly a heavenly marshal, he was cursed with his awful form as punishment for lusting after [Chang’e](Chang’e.md). In Arthur Waley’s translation, Bajie was renamed as Pigsy.
