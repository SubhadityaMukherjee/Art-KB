# A Bad Dream

- Henry Fuseli was a leading figure of (<https://mymodernmet.com/what-is-romanticism/),> a 19th-century art movement defined by dreamy iconography. In his most famous (and aptly named) painting, _The Nightmare_, Fuseli delves into the scary side of the subconscious.
- This spine-tingling work of art shows a sleeping woman with an incubus—a male demon that preys upon women as they sleep—perched on her body. A ghostly horse emerges from behind a red velvet curtain, forming the only perceivable part of the blackened background.
- Most art historians believe that _The Nightmare_ was inspired by German folktales. According to legend, men who slept alone were visited by horse specters, while lone women were possessed by demons or the devil. By incorporating both of these frightening figures in the composition, Fuseli visually represents the manifestation of a living nightmare.
