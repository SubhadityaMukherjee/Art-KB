# Yuan Dynasty Clothes
- The Yuan Dynasty was the first foreign-ruled era in China. The Hanfu in this period adopted features from the Mongolian rulers' national dress.
- Men not only wore the traditional Han-style round-collar pao, but also wore the Mongolian zhisunfu (jisum in Mongolian).
- The following dress code (Zhisunfu code) was just formulated in 1321 during the reign of Yuan Emperor Yingzong by referring to ancient systems: upper and lower short garments were pieced together; folds were added to the waistline, and big beads were hung on shoulders and the back. Emperors and officials in all ranks wore such garments, and the Han people called them as the Yiseyi garments or Zhisunfu garments.
- Women's garments of the Yuan Dynasty included aristocratic type and common-people type. Aristocrats were often the Mongols. Their national costumes were fur coats and fur caps. The garments made of marten and sheepskin was very common, and most garments were robes with narrow cuffs and loose sleeves.
- This featured an yi (upper garment) that reached the knees with narrow sleeves and a short shang (lower garment).
