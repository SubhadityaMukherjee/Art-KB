# The Giants

- If the Giants were aggressive creatures that care about petty little arguments among other living things, they would certainly be number one on this list. I’m not even sure if the Giants can be killed, or even hurt. Basically, when they lay down and sleep, the Giants are just huge mountains that you’d never guess were even alive.
- However, we’ve seen two Giants in the Hobbit, goofing around, throwing colossal boulders at one another – big enough to crush a small village on a whim. They aren’t really that well-represented in Tolkien’s writings, and he imagined the Giants to be no more than 100 feet (30.5 meters) tall.
- However, Peter Jackson reimagined them for The Hobbit, being as big as real mountains, and having no interest in Bilbo and the Dwarves passing by them whatsoever.
