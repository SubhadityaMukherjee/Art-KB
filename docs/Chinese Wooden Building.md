# Chinese Wooden Building
- One of the characteristics of traditional Chinese architecture is the use of wooden structural frame with pillars, beams. The doors and windows are also made by timber. Chinese have used wood as a main construction material for thousands of years. 
- Post and Lintel , or in contemporary usage Post and beam, is a simple construction method using a lintel or header as the horizontal member over a building void supported at its ends by vertical columns, pillars, or posts. 
- This architectural system and building method has been used for thousands of years to support the weight of the structure located above the openings created in a bearing wall.
