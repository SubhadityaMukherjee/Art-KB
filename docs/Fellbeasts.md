# Fellbeasts

- Many casual fans are mistaken when they think the Nazgul and the Fellbeasts are the same thing. In reality, the Nazgul are the faceless, hooded wraiths that ride Fellbeasts. The creatures have distinct physical attributes, such as long, skin-covered wings, elongated necks, huge teeth, and a terrifying screech that shakes Middle-earth when it’s heard.
- Although they usually do the bidding of the Nazgul, their masters, Fellbeasts are actually quite powerful on their own. They are agile, strong, fast, and insanely good at hunting. They would probably be even higher on this list if they didn’t have one simple weakness – sunlight.
- No, they don’t turn to stone like Trolls, but Fellbeasts are affected – even hurt – by direct sunlight, as seen when Gandalf marched towards them and projected beams of light towards them in front of Minas Tirith.
