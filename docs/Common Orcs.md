# Common Orcs

- Orcs are artificially created creatures, primarily made to be slaves and servants to the Dark Lord. They are one of the lowest intelligent life forms in Middle-earth, usually just serving the purpose they were created for until they die.
- While there are some more advanced Orcs, such as the Uruk-hai, who are strong and intelligent warriors, most Orcs are weak, dumb creatures that serve as cannon meat – it’s about quantity, not quality for these dudes. An above-average Man warrior can slice through a group of common Orcs without breaking a sweat.
