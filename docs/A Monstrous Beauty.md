# A Monstrous Beauty

- Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, 'Medusa,' 1597 (Photo: (<https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Medusa_by_Carvaggio.jpg),> Public domain)
- (<https://mymodernmet.com/caravaggio-paintings/)> drew on the ancient Greek myth of Medusa for this frightening painting. It depicts the severed head of Medusa, a mythical monster who's described as a female woman with bronze hands and countless venomous snakes for hair. Legend has it that anyone who even so much as glanced at her would be turned to stone. Medusa was cursed by the Greek goddess [Athena](Athena.md), who turned her into the venomous monster she became. Perseus, son of Greek god Zeus and princess Danae, decapitated Medusa using a shield given by [Athena](Athena.md).
- Caravaggio made two versions of his _Medusa_ painting—one in 1596 and the other in 1597. In this work, Caravaggio used a mirror and painted his own face in the place of Medusa. He did so to indicate his immunity to her terrified expression. Though the head is decapitated, it still appears conscious, capturing Medusa's final horrific moments. Blood pours out from her severed neck, while her mouth hangs wide open, baring teeth.
