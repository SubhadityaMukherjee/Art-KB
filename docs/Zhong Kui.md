# Zhong Kui
- In Chinese folklore, Zhong Kui was a brilliant scholar who was denied his rightful official post because of his savage appearance. After committing suicide, Zhong Kui was made a vanquisher of evil spirits by the King of Hell. In some versions of the story, the indignant scholar was also given the mythical title of the King of Ghosts.
- In the mythological folklore, Zhong Kui is regarded as a vanquisher of ghosts and evil beings. He committed suicide upon being unfairly stripped of his title of "Zhuangyuan" (top-scorer) of the Imperial Examinations by the emperor, due to his disfigured and ugly appearance. His spirit was condemned to Hell because suicide was considered a grave sin, but Yama (the Chinese Hell King) judged him worthy of the title "King of Ghosts" in Diyu (Hell). Yama tasked him to hunt, capture, take charge of, and maintain discipline and order of all ghosts. On Chinese New Year's eve, Zhong Kui returned to his hometown to repay the kindness of his friend Du Ping (杜平).
