# Zhong Kui 
- In Chinese folklore, Zhong Kui was a brilliant scholar who was denied his rightful official post because of his savage appearance. After committing suicide, Zhong Kui was made a vanquisher of evil spirits by the King of Hell. In some versions of the story, the indignant scholar was also given the mythical title of the King of Ghosts.
