# Self Obliteration by Ron Athey
- Ideas of masculinity, sexual desire, and trauma are picked apart in Ron Atheyâ€™s extreme body art and performance art. Athey was born in America and has centered a large part of his work around HIV awareness. His controversial work focuses on performing physical acts to his body as a way of transcending bodily pain. In Self Obliteration, Athey sat in a glass box wearing nothing but a long blonde wig with needles hidden underneath against his scalp. As he brushed the wig, blood spurted from his scalp onto the surrounding glass walls.
