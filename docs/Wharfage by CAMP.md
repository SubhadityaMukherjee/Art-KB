# Wharfage by CAMP
- CAMP (Computer Appropriating Missing Promises) is the name of an Indian collaboration space, decidedly not a collective, with philosophies relating to the current intersection of technology, culture, and how to disrupt the tired narratives of post-modern binaries. The group's ongoing project Wharfage examines how the business of business is "better than the business of war" by engaging with sailors on that trade between the United Arab Emirates, Gujarat, and Somalia. On the surface, it's an exercise in record keeping, but it goes much deeper when presented in the global context of reshaping space as areas of truly free trade.
