# Sopdu (Soped or Sopedu)
- A protective god of the eastern border of Egypt who guarded over the outposts and soldiers on the frontier. He is depicted as a falcon with a flail over the right wing or as a bearded man with a crown featuring two feathers. Sopdu was associated with Horus and the deified king in his astral form. Wilkinson writes, "The deceased king, in his role as Osiris-Orion, is said to impregnate Isis as the star [Sothis](Sothis.md) and to produce Horus-Sopdu" (211). In the earthly realm, he ensured the proper resources reached the eastern border garrisons and helped the king control native populations in those regions.
