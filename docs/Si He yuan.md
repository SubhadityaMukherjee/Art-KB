# Si He Yuan
- Courtyard House
- Siheyuan is the traditional courtyard-style residence of Beijing. This architectural style is world-famous for its unsophisticatedness and elegance as well as its unique artistic attainment.
- It is called Siheyuan because the houses in it are constructed in such a way that zhengfang, xiangfang and daozuo are connected with walls and that the whole complex creates an enclosed square courtyard.
- It has been several hundred years since this kind of architectural form took shape
