# Daoism
- The history of Taoism stretches throughout Chinese history.
- Laozi is traditionally regarded as the founder of Taoist religion and is closely associated in this context with "original", or "primordial", Taoism
- dated between the 8th and 3rd century BC
- Taoism clearly predates Laozi (Lao Tzu as he refers to "The Tao masters of antiquity"
- Moreover, the Yellow_Emperor), Huangdi (2697–2597 BCE is often associated with the origin of the Tao
- many Taoist practices drew from the Warring_States_era phenomena of the Wu (shaman
- Fangshi (which probably derived from the "archivist-soothsayers of antiquity, one of whom supposedly was Laozi himself")
## Zhou Dynasty (770–256 BCE)
- Laozi was a scholar who worked as the Keeper of the Archives for the royal court of Zhou_dynasty)
- allowed him broad access to the works of the Yellow_Emperor and other classics of the time
- Laozi grew weary of the moral decay of life in Chengzhou and noted the kingdom's decline. He ventured west to live as a hermit in the unsettled frontier at the age of 80. At the western gate of the city (or kingdom), he was recognized by the guard Yinxi). The sentry asked the old master to record his wisdom for the good of the country before he would be permitted to pass. The text Laozi wrote was said to be the Tao_Te_Ching), although the present version of the text includes additions from later periods. In some versions of the tale, the sentry was so touched by the work that he became a disciple and left with Laozi, never to be seen again
- As such, many of the Zhou-era Taoist texts are sourced during the Han dynasty, and the existence of many of the Zhou-era Taoist sages and texts are still disputed.
## Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE)
- The term Daojia (usually translated as "philosophical Taoism" was coined during the Han_dynasty).
- refers to immortal
- earliest commentary on the Dao De Jing is that of Heshang_Gong (the "Riverside Master"), a legendary figure depicted as a teacher to the Han emperor.
- A major text from the Huang-Lao movement would be the Huainanzi), which interprets earlier works of the Taoist canon in light of the quest for immortality.
- The first organized form of Taoism, the Tianshi_Dao (Celestial Masters' school (later known as Zhengyi_Dao school), developed from the Five_Pecks_of_Rice movement at the end of the 2nd century CE; the latter had been founded by Zhang_Daoling), who claimed that Laozi appeared to him in the year 142.History_of_Taoism -19 The Tianshi school was officially recognized by ruler Cao_Cao in 215, legitimizing Cao Cao's rise to power in return.History_of_Taoism -20 Laozi received imperial recognition as a divinity in the mid-2nd century.History_of_Taoism -21)
## Three Kingdoms Period (220–265)
- During the Three_Kingdoms_Period), the Xuanxue (Mysterious Wisdom school, including Wang_Bi), focused on the texts of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Many of the school's members, including Wang Bi himself, were not religious in any sense
- Wang Bi mostly focused on reconciling Confucian thought with Taoist thought.
- Because the version of the Tao Te Ching that has been passed on to the present is the one that Wang Bi commented upon, his interpretations became very influential as they were passed on alongside the Tao Te Ching.
## Six Dynasties (316–589)
- Taoist alchemist Ge_Hong), also known as Baopuzi (
- 抱扑子
- The 'Master Embracing Simplicity' was active in the third and fourth centuries and had great influence on later Taoism

- 上清
- 'Supreme Clarity' (365–370 and Lingbao_School (
- 靈寶
- 'Sacred Treasure' scriptures (397–402 received at Maoshan
- They spoke of the Shangqing heaven, which stood above what had been previously considered the highest heaven by Celestial Master Taoists. Yang Xi's revelations consisted of visitations from the residents of this heaven (the "Zhenren)" many of whom were ancestors of a circle of aristocrats from southern China.
- These Zhenren spoke of an apocalypse which was to arrive in 384, and claimed that only certain people from this aristocratic circle had been chosen to be saved. For the first century of its existence, Shangqing Taoism was isolated to this aristocratic circle. However, Tao_Hongjing (456–536 codified and wrote commentaries on Yang Xi's writings and allowed for the creation of Shangqing Taoism as a popular religion
- The Lingbao scriptures added some Buddhist elements such as an emphasis on universal salvation.History_of_Taoism -27)
- Also during the Six_Dynasties period, the Celestial Master movement re-emerged in two distinct forms. The_Northern_Celestial_Masters were founded in 424 century by Kou_Qianzhi), and a Taoist theocracy was established that lasted until 450 CE.History_of_Taoism -28 After this time, the Northern Celestial Masters were expelled from the Wei court and re-established themselves at Louguan where they survived into the Tang_dynasty).
- These various followers of The Way of the Celestial Master coalesced to form a distinct form of Taoism known as the Southern Celestial Masters, who lasted as a distinct movement into the fifth century.
## Tang Dynasty (618–907)
- Taoism gained official status in China during the Tang Dynasty, whose emperors claimed Laozi as their relative.History_of_Taoism -31 However, it was forced to compete with Confucianism and Buddhism), its major rivals, for patronage and rank.
- Emperor Emperor_Xuanzong_of_Tang (685–762), who ruled at the height of the Tang, wrote commentaries on texts from all three of these traditions, which exemplifies the fact that in many people's lives they were not mutually exclusive.
- The Emperor_Gaozong_of_Tang added the Tao Te Ching to the list of classics (jing,
- 經
- to be studied for the imperial examinations.
# Song Dynasty (960–1279)

- The Quanzhen school of Taoism was founded during this period, and together with the resurgent Celestial Masters called the Zhengyi_Dao is one of the two schools of Taoism that have survived to the present.History_of_Taoism -35)
- The Song_dynasty saw an increasingly complex interaction between the elite traditions of organised Taoism as practised by ordained Taoist ministers (daoshi and the local traditions of Folk_religion as practised by spirit mediums (wu and a new class of non-ordained ritual experts known as fashi.
- This interaction manifested itself in the integration of 'converted' local deities into the bureaucratically organised Taoist pantheon and the emergence of new exorcistic rituals, including the Celestial_Heart_Rite and the Thunder_Rite).
# Yuan Dynasty (1279–1367)
- Taoism suffered a significant setback in 1281 when many copies of the Daozang were ordered burned. This destruction gave Taoism a chance to renew itself.
- Neidan), a form of Internal_alchemy), became a major emphasis of the Quanzhen sect, whose practitioners followed a monastic model inspired by Buddhism. One of its leaders, Qiu Chuji became a teacher of Genghis_Khan before the establishment of the Yuan_dynasty)
- Originally from Shanxi and Shandong), the sect established its main center in Beijing)'s White_Cloud_Temple ("White Cloud Monastery").History_of_Taoism -40 Before the end of the dynasty, the Celestial Masters sect (and Buddhism again gained preeminence.History_of_Taoism -41)
## Ming Dynasty (1368–1644)
- In 1406, Yongle_Emperor of Ming_dynasty commanded that all Taoist texts be collected and combined into a new version of the Daozang. The text was finally finished in 1447, and took nearly forty years to complete.History_of_Taoism -42)
## Qing Dynasty (1644–1912)
- The fall of the Ming Dynasty and the subsequent establishment of the Qing_dynasty by the Manchus was blamed by some literati on religion, specifically Taoism. They sought to regain power by advocating a return to Confucianism orthodoxy in a movement called Hanxue, or "Han_Learning)." This movement returned the Confucian classics to favor and nearly completely rejected Taoism. During the eighteenth century, the Siku_Quanshu was constituted, but excluded virtually all Taoist books.History_of_Taoism -43)
