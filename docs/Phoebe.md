# [[Phoebe]]
- When you think of Greek mythology, you probably think of the gods of Mount Olympus, like [Zeus](Zeus.md). However, there were two preceding generations of Greek deities
-  the Protogenoi and the Titans. As the daughter of Protogenoi [deities](Deities.md) Ouranos (Sky) and Gaia (Earth), Phoebe was a member of the Titans. Today, her name means “pure, radiant, bright, shining.”
