# [[Aphrodite.md]]
- Known as Venus in Roman mythology, Aphrodite is popularly known as the goddess of love and sexuality. But it doesn’t stop there — she was born from the white foam that Heavne/[[Uranus.md]]’ severed genitals created in the ocean after his son tossed them into the water, so she’s also known as a goddess of war and the sea. You might want to skip the whole “severed genitals” thing though when you tell people about the meaning behind the name.
