# Bai Suzhen 
- A white snake spirit who achieved human form after centuries of cultivation, Bai Suzhen made the mistake of loving and marrying human physician Xu Xian. For his sake, she then battled [[Fa Hai.md]], an exorcist monk who vehemently opposed their marriage. She also used her magic to flood his temple. After defeat by [[Fa Hai.md]], Bai Suzhen was imprisoned in the Thunder Peak Pagoda.
