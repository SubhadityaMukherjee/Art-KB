# Gochugaru
- These freshly ground Gochugaru chili flakes are a third condiment on the table in Korean houses. Use these chili flakes to cook traditional Korean dishes like gochujang (Korean chili paste), kimchi, kimchi jjigae, and Kkotgetang. These red chiles are freshly ground into coarse flakes and have a sweet, intense flavor with medium heat.
