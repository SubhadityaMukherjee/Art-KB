# Ras El Hanout
- Roughly translating to "top of the shop" in Arabic, the prized Moroccan Ras el Hanout is meant to comprise the very best a spice merchant has to offer. Individual spices are freshly ground and expertly blended and incorporated into traditional Morrocan tagines, couscous or grilled lamb or chicken dishes.
