# The Elysian Fields
- Only the cream of the crop makes it into Elysium or the Elysian Fields. The ancient Greeks’ version of heaven was deemed by Homer as a place of perfect happiness, sitting on the edge of the Earth with a soft breeze blowing over from the river Oceanus. While immoral souls were sent to perish in Hades’ underworld, the most virtuous and heroic of mankind – the so-called 'deserving dead' – were selected to live here. It’s a land where golden fruit is plentiful; according to The Odyssey, 'there falls not rain, nor hail, nor snow'.
