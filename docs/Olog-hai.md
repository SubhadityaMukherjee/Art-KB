# Olog-hai

- I’ve mentioned that Trolls can only be active during the night because sunlight turns them into stone. But, we’ve seen Trolls in The Siege of Minas Tirith, happening during the day, and they weren’t turned to stone, right? Well, not quite. Those aren’t Trolls, but Olog-hai. Basically, what the Uruk-hai are for Orcs, the Olog-hai are for Trolls.
- They are advanced Troll sub-species created by Sauron to be more useful and effective, not just in combat, but also as labor workers. Basically, the main difference between common Trolls and Olog-hai is that their main weakness has been removed – they can walk underneath the sun without getting turned into stone.
