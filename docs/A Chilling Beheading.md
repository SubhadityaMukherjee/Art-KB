# A Chilling Beheading

- As one of the pioneers of Romanticism, French artist Théodore Géricault was known for utilizing grand scale and dramatic narratives in his paintings. While _The Raft of the Medusa_ is his most beloved work, he created a number of other works during his short life. Paintings like _The Severed Heads_ reveal Géricault's keen interest in the macabre. Here, he portrays a pair of severed heads nestled in bloodstained cloth.
- This painting was part of a series of still lifes Géricault made that focused on the human body. He depicted these eerie subjects to study anatomy and the way bodies decay.
