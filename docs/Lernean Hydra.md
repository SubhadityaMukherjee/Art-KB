# Lernean Hydra

- The Lernean Hydra, also known as the Hydra of Lerna, was a mythical creature in Greek and Roman mythologies that lived in the lake of Lerna in the Argolid region.
- Like Cerberus, Chimera and many other Greek monsters in mythology, the Lernean Hydra was also known as the offspring of monsters Typhon and Echidna.
- According to the belief, the Lernean Hydra had nine heads, she breathed poison and her blood was so deadly that even the scent of it was enough to kill.
- The Lernean Hydra was killed by the divine hero Hercules as it was the second one of his labors set by King Eurystheus.
- In the myth, every time Hercules cut off one of the Lernean Hydra’s heads two new ones replaced it. In the end, Hercules asked for help from his nephew, Iolaus. Iolaus burned off Hydra’s necks as Hercules cut the heads off. That worked and Hercules finally slew the beast.
- As a modern reference, the evil Hydra organization in the comic books by Marvel Comics, TV shows like _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D_ and movies in Marvel Cinematic Universe used the Lernean Hydra as its symbol along with the motto 'If a head is cut off, two more shall take its place'.
