# Rubbed Sage
- Rubbed sage has a velvet-like texture, with slightly crumpled leaves that gives flavor that will last longer than the powdered variant. Store in a cool, dry place for no more than 6 months. We love using this in a typical poultry stuffing or pork sausage but sage also pairs well with balsamic vinegar, cheese, lemons, mushrooms, garlic, and onions.
