# Lageay Lengkuos
- the greatest of heroes and a shaman (beliyan) who made the earth and forests
- the only one who could pass the magnet stone in the straight between the big and little oceans
- inverted the directions where east became west, inverted the path of the sun, and made the water into land and land into water
