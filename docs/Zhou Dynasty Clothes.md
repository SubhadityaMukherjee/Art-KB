# Zhou Dynasty Clothes
- In the Zhou Dynasty (1045 – 771 BC), Kings of the Western Zhou Dynasty set up a strict hierarchical system linked by blood lineage and ethical norms based on families.
- Clothes Were Used as a Status Symbol to Accentuate Their Privileges, Which Had a Substantial Impact on Clothes and Ornaments, Owing to Great Differences Between the Nobility and the Common People.
- [[Shenyi]] (one-piece clothing) and Mianfu (a religious court dress of ancient emperors and officials) emerged in the Eastern Zhou period (770 – 221 BC).
- Hanfu Sleeves Were Made Wider, and the Outer Tunic Was Closed with Jade Decorations or a Sash. The Cross-over Collar Appeared.
- Other Ethnic Groups' Clothing, Such as Hufu (clothes of Northern Ethnic Groups Such as the Huns), Was Established and Blended with Hanfu.
- Yellow for example was exclusively reserved for the Emperor. Things like the length of one’s skirt, the width of sleeves and the extent of ornamentation demonstrated one’s place in society.
- The Yi was wrapped right side over left in a style called Jiaoling Youren, which favors right handed people, a tradition practically universal around the world.
