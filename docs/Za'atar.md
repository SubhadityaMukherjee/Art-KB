# Za'atar
- Freshly ground sumac berries, toasted sesame seeds and dried thyme and flaky sea salt give this Israeli classic a nutty, floral flavor to dips, pizza & rubs. Stir into olive oil and pile onto crusty bread or sprinkle on eggs, tuck into a Lebanese style pizza or use as dry rub on chicken or vegetables.
