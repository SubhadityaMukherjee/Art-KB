# God of Animals
- the deity of animals who allowed the creatures to speak but forbade them from dancing
- when a king heard of an island filled with dogs, he ordered a captain to get some of them
- the captain ordered the dogs which they did, angering the god of animals who struck their ship with lightning, killing the captain and turning the dogs and ship into an island called Tagbayanga, which now protects the town of Pilar from strong winds and waves
