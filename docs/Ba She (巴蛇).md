# Ba She (巴蛇)
- According to _Shan Hai Jing_, Ba She is an immense snake  
	capable of swallowing entire elephants. This myth, in turn, gave rise to  
	the Chinese saying, _ren xin bu zu she tun xiang_ (人心不足蛇吞象), which  
	translated as 'Man’s greed is worse than the snake that swallows  
	elephants.'
