# Loup Garou/Rougarou

- Loup garou is one of the most popular mythical monsters throughout the world joining our list from Cajun and French Canadian folklore.
- Also known as rougarou, this creature is basically French and Cajun counterpart of a werewolf.
- A person becomes a loup garou if he or she is put under a specific loup garou curse. On the other hand, French Catholics believed that a person became a loup garou if he broke the rules of Lent for 7 years in a row.
- Loup garous are very agile and strong creatures. They are weak against fire which is considered by many people to be the only way to kill them.
- Cutting the head off or cutting the whole body into pieces are believed to be the other ways to kill a loup garou.
