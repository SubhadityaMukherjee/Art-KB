# Gothmog

- Balrogs are unfathomably powerful. The Lord of all Balrogs is something way, way worse. Gothmog, the Lord of the Balrogs in the First Age, was Morgoth’s High Captain of Angbard – meaning, he had the same title as Sauron during the time Morgoth was the Dark Lord.
- Durin’s Bane killed a Dwarven king, whereas Gothmog destroyed two High Kings of the Noldor Elves. The creature is insanely powerful, wielding a flaming whip, and a colossal black ax, and was so mighty that they eventually broke free of Melkor and claimed Angbard as their own. The most powerful Balrog ever, Gothmog, certainly deserves a special spot on this list.
