# Sha Wujing 
- The third disciple of [Tang Sanzang](Tang%20Sanzang.md) is always depicted as a Chinese “wild monk,” and within the saga, was the voice of reason and mediation. Before the pilgrimage, Sha was also a heavenly general. He was punished with the task after he destroyed a previous vase during a fit of anger.
