# The Abhartach 

- Now, it’s widely known that Bram Stoker’s Dracula has close ties to Ireland.
- The author was, of course, born in Dublin. However, it’s not Dracula that we’re referring to, here. The tale of the Abhartach is one that’s hard to debunk, and many believe that it’s real.
- In (<https://www.theirishroadtrip.com/the-abhartach/),> we tell the story of this Celtic mythological creature, and offer insight into where in Ireland it roamed (and where it’s now buried).
