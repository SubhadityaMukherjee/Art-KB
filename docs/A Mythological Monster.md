# A Mythological Monster

- Between 1819 and 1823, the Spanish artist (<https://mymodernmet.com/francisco-goya-art/)> created his _Black Paintings_, a series of 14 particularly haunting pieces. Among the most famous of these frightening works of art is _Saturn Devouring His Son_, a gruesome painting of a father feasting on his child.
- According to Roman mythology, Saturn (Cronus in Greek folklore) was the leader of the Titans. Saturn overthrew his father, Caelus, in an effort to become ruler of the universe. Fearing his own offspring would do the same, he killed and consumed each child shortly after birth—an atrocity Goya opted to portray in this _Black Painting_.
- Goya did not create this series for the public. In fact, they were intended to decorate his own home, with _Saturn Devouring His Son_ hanging—where else?—in the dining room.
