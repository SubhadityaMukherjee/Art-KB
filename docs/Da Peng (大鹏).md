# Da Peng (大鹏)
- In Zhuangzi’s _Xiaoyao You_, Da Peng was a huge bird whose  
	wing flaps were capable of stirring the seas. Originally an immense fish  
	thousands of miles long known as a Kun, comparative mythologists have  
	likened Da Peng to the Arabic Roc and the Hindu Garuda. Scholars continue  
	to debate about the symbolic meaning of Zhuangzi’s peculiar tale.
