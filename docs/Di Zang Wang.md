# Di Zang Wang 
- Di Zang Wang is the Chinese name for Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha. A guardian of souls, Chinese depiction of him is inevitably that of a monk donning a splendid cassock. Note that while the Chinese character “wang” (王) means king or duke, Di Zang Wang is neither the King of Hell nor the Chinese god of death. Within China, Di Zang Wang is also associated with Mount Jiuhua.
