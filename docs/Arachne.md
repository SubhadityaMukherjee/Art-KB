# Arachne

- Arachne is a legendary creature in Greek mythology mentioned as the first spider in the world.
- According to the legend, Arachne was firstly a human being, a young woman with excellent skill in weaving who was too proud of her work.
- When asked whether her amazing gift of weaving was given to her by Athena, Arachne said she did not need any teaching from Athena and challenged the goddess for a weaving competition.
- Disguised as an old woman later on, Athena tried to warn Arachne to be respectful and not offend gods but Arachne kept acting in an insulting and disrespectful manner. Athena revealed herself and accepted her challenge.
- According to the first version of the myth, Arachne’s work for the competition was insulting on gods as she pictured them in shameful ways.
- Athena touched Arachne’s head (or hit according to some accounts) and made her feel shame and guilt for her insult on gods. Arachne killed herself after that but, feeling sorry for how things developed, Athena did not let her die and turned Arachne into a spider.
- In the second version of the myth, Arachne did an excellent job but her work was not even close to Athena’s work.
- Having won the contest and seeing Arachne’s passion for weaving, Athena turned her into a spider and commanded that she and her descendants would weave until the end of time.
