# Death is Victorious

- Pieter Bruegel the Elder, 'The Triumph of Death' 1562 (Photo: (<https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Triumph_of_Death_by_Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder.jpg),> Public domain)
- For many, few things are scarier than death itself. In Pieter Bruegel the Elder's 1562 paintingÂ _The Triumph of Death_, an army of skeletons consumes the barren landscape that's on fire and absolutely wrecked. The army destroys the living and they have no chance of achieving salvation. Highly detailed and gruesome, the piece begs a long look to truly take in the unsettling sights of pure chaos.
- This piece was a 'moral work' by Bruegel and influenced by the idea of the _Dance of Death_. Also called the _Danse Macabre_, it's based on a medieval artistic allegory that death unites us all, no matter our station in life.
