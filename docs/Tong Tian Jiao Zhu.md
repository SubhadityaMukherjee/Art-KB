# Tong Tian Jiao Zhu 
- In the saga, Tong Tian was a fellow disciple of Laozi and [Yuan Shi Tian Jun](Yuan%20Shi%20Tian%20Jun.md), and the spiritual leader of the Shang forces. A secondary plot of the saga was the supernatural conflict between Laozi’s Chan (阐) Sect and Tong Tian’s Jie (截) Sect, these sects being the respective patrons of the Zhou and Shang forces. The two magical factions ultimately reached an armistice in the final third of the saga.
1# Yang Jian 
- One of the most powerful warriors of the Zhou Forces, Yang Jian was based on Erlang Shen, a widely worshiped deity in Taoism. His defining feature is that of a third “heavenly eye” on his forehead. Capable of a vast variety of supernatural abilities and assisted by a heavenly hound, Yang Jian was near undefeatable throughout the saga too. In _Journey to the West,_ Yang Jian famously fought [Sun Wukong](Sun%20Wukong.md). He was furthermore the only warrior god from the Jade Emperor’s pantheon able to battle the Monkey King to a standstill.
1# Zhou Wu Wang 
- Also referred to by his ancestral name of Ji Fa , Zhou Wu Wang was historically, the first emperor of the Ancient Zhou Dynasty. He largely retained this identity in _Investiture of the Gods_, leading the Zhou forces till their ultimate victory over the Shang Dynasty
