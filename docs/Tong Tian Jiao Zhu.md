# Tong Tian Jiao Zhu

- In the saga, Tong Tian was a fellow disciple of Laozi and [Yuan Shi Tian Jun](Yuan%20Shi%20Tian%20Jun.md.md), and the spiritual leader of the Shang forces. A secondary plot of the saga was the supernatural conflict between Laozi’s Chan (阐) Sect and Tong Tian’s Jie (截) Sect, these sects being the respective patrons of the Zhou and Shang forces. The two magical factions ultimately reached an armistice in the final third of the saga.
