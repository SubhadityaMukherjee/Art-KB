# A Creepy-Crawly Creature

- In 1887, French Symbolist artist (<https://mymodernmet.com/odilon-redon-art/)> created _The Smiling Spider_, a lithograph of an unusual arachnid with ten legs. Still, even with this extra set of limbs, the most peculiar thing about this spider is its unsettling grin, which the artist has delineated with a row of tiny teeth.
- _The Smiling Spider_ is one of many _noirs_, or 'blacks' created by Redon between 1870 and 1890. Rendered in charcoal and as lithographs, these pieces illustrate the artist's interest in the obscure and, most importantly, are characterized by darkness—both in color and subject matter.
- 'Black is the most essential color,' Redon (<https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/1587/releases/MOMA_1952_0009_8.pdf).> 'It conveys the very vitality of a being, his energy, his mind, something of his soul, the reflection of his sensitivity. One must respect black. Nothing prostitutes it. It does not please the eye and it awakens no sensuality. It is the agent of the mind far more than the most beautiful color of the palette or prism.'
