# [Nuwa & Fuxi](Nuwa%20&%20Fuxi.md.md)

- Nuwa and Fuxi were the mother and father deities of human beings. Nuwa was born at the beginning of creation and fixed the mistakes made at first so that everything was perfect. She built a (<https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/palace/)> for herself, which became the model for (<https://www.worldhistory.org/Chinese_Architecture/),> and lived there with her friend and brother Fuxi, both depicted as human-dragons with human heads and (Dragon.md.md) bodies or human bodies to the waist and (Dragon.md.md) legs and tails.
- Nuwa became lonely and created human beings for company from the mud of the Yellow River. She breathed life into them and they moved and lived. She continued to make more and more human beings but it was tiring work and so she created marriage so that they could reproduce themselves. The humans were alive but had no knowledge of anything and so Fuxi gave them the gifts of fire, (<https://www.worldhistory.org/writing/),> how to get food from the sea, and all the other skills they would need to live. He also gave them the gifts of (<https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/Music/),> culture, and divination so they could make good decisions by knowing what the future held.
- After Gong-Gong "Gong-Gong") was said to have damaged the world pillar holding the earth and sky apart, the sky was rent causing fires, floods (the Flood_of_Nuwa&action=edit&redlink=1 "Flood of Nuwa (page does not exist)")) and other devastating events which were only remedied when Nüwa repaired the sky with five colored stones. The figure of Nüwa, also referred to as Nü Kwa, appeared in literature no earlier than c. 350 BCE. It is sometimes believed that Nüwa molded humans from clay to populate or re-populate the world, thus creating modern humans.
