# Yu Huang Da Di 
- More widely known as the “Jade Emperor” outside of China, Yu Huang Da Di is the Taoist ruler of heaven. Unlike other cultures, though, he is not the supreme deity in Chinese myths; some beliefs even regard him as merely a representative of the Three Purities. Within Chinese fantasy stories and sagas, the Jade Emperor typically represents traditional social hierarchies and taboos.
