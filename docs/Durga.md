# Durga

- is the goddess of protection and a central figure in the eternal struggle between good and evil. She first came to the world to fight a buffalo demon who was terrorizing the land, and she stayed as one of the most powerful goddesses of Hinduism.
- In most depictions, Durga appears riding a lion into battle and holding weapons. In these artworks, Durga has between eight and eighteen arms, and each hand carries a different weapon to the battlefield. Durga is the protectress of good and the destroyer of evil. She is also worshipped as a mother goddess. Her principal festival is the Durga-puja, which takes place yearly in September or October. In some accounts, she is the consort of Shiva.
