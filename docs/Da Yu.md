# Da Yu 
- In Chinese mythology, Yu was the founder of the Xia Dynasty and famous for controlling the Great Flood of China. His father, Gun, was tasked by King Yao to contain the flood and once of age, Yu joined the efforts, succeeding where his father failed. To reward him, King Yao’s successor, Shun, appointed Yu as the new ruler of China. Note that “Da” is not part of Yu’s name. That character means “Big” or “Great.” Yu is one of the rare Chinese rulers accorded this honor.
