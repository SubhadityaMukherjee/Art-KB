# Erzhong Ren (耳中人)
- A truly, truly weird creature introduced in the  
	second story of _(https
- //owlcation.com/humanities/liaozhai-ghosts-demons)_  
	i.e. the critically acclaimed Qing Dynasty compilation of Chinese  
	supernatural stories. According to the tale, a scholar diligently practiced  
	a mythical form of _qigong_, and one day, heard a tiny voice in his ear.  
	The second time it happened, a miniature ogre also crawled its way out.  
	Unfortunately, before the scholar could have a heart-to-heart talk with the  
	creature, a door knock startled the ogre and sent it scuttling away in  
	panic. Thereafter, the scholar was delirious for half a year. It is up to  
	the reader to decide whether author Pu Songling intended the creepy story  
	to be a metaphor for schizophrenia.
