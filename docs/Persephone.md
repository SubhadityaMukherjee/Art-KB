# [Persephone](Persephone.md)
- You might think a name that means “bringer of death” is a bit dark. However, in Greek mythology, Persephone played a very important role as the daughter of Demeter and [Zeus](Zeus.md) and the wife of Hades — the latter of which made her the Queen of the Underworld. Her abduction by Hades is often used to explain the reason for seasons on Earth.
