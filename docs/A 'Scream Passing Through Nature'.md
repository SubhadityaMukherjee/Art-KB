# A 'Scream Passing Through Nature'

- Expressionist artist (<https://mymodernmet.com/edvard-munch-facts/)> is renowned for his dark and dreary paintings and prints. From 1893 until 1910, he produced his most famous masterpiece, _The_ _Scream_, as a series of 4 works.
- During this 17-year period, Munch recreated (<https://mymodernmet.com/edvard-munch-the-scream-painting/)> in crayon, tempera paint, and oil pastel. While the mediums vary from piece to piece, each one features the same subject matter: a mysterious figure standing on a bridge and holding his face as he screams.
- While this scene appears dream-like, it was actually inspired by a (<https://mymodernmet.com/settings-of-famous-paintings/)> and a particularly frightening phenomenon. 'One evening I was walking along a path, the city was on one side and the fjord below,' Munch wrote in his diary. 'I felt tired and ill. I stopped and looked out over the fjord—the sun was setting, and the clouds turning blood red. I sensed a scream passing through nature; it seemed to me that I heard the scream. I painted this picture, painted the clouds as actual blood. The color shrieked. This became _The Scream._'
