# Anat
- Goddess of fertility, sexuality, love, and war. She was originally from syria or canaan. In some texts she is referred to as the Mother of the Gods while in others she is a virgin and, in still others, sensuous and erotic, described as the most beautiful goddess. In one version of The Contendings of Horus and Set, she is given as a consort to Set at the suggestion of the goddess Neith. Often equated with Aphrodite of greece, astarte of phoenicia, Inanna of Mesopotamia, and Sauska of the hittite.
