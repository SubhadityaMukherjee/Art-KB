# [Shangti](Shangti.md)
- Shangti was the supreme god of [law](https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/law/), order, justice, and creation. He is also known as [Jade Emperor](https://www.worldhistory.org/Jade_Emperor/), Yellow Emperor, or Yu Huang Shang-Ti, although there are sometimes important distinctions made between these names and Jade Emperor can mean another deity. Shangti was considered the great ancestor of all Chinese, who gave the people [culture](https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/culture/), [architecture](https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/architecture/), skill in [battle](https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/battle/), [agriculture](https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/Agriculture/), controlled the weather, regulated the seasons, and was king over the other gods, human beings, and nature. He was worshipped primarily during the [Shang Dynasty](https://www.worldhistory.org/Shang_Dynasty/) (1600-1046 BCE) when he was considered a deified king who ruled c. 2697-2597 BCE and was included in the mythical or semi-mythical grouping of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, demi-gods who ruled China between c. 2852-2070 BCE. During the [Zhou Dynasty](https://www.worldhistory.org/Zhou_Dynasty/) (c. 1046-226 BCE) Shangti was replaced by the concept of Tian (Heaven) but re-emerged as Shangti during the [Warring States Period](https://www.worldhistory.org/Warring_States_Period/) (476-221 BCE). The [Zhou](https://www.worldhistory.org/Zhou_Dynasty/) developed the concept of the [Mandate of Heaven](https://www.worldhistory.org/Mandate_of_Heaven/) which legitimized the rule of a certain dynasty. Tian judged who was worthy to rule and for how long, and when a dynasty was no longer fit, it fell and another took its place.
