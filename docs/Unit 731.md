# Unit 731
- Prisoners of war were subjected to vivisection without anesthesia.
- Vivisections were conducted on detainees after infecting them with various diseases.
- Scientists performed invasive surgery on prisoners, removing organs to study the effects of disease on the human body.
- The experiments were conducted while the patients were alive because it was feared that the decomposition process would affect the results.
- Human targets were used to test grenades positioned at various distances and in different positions.
- Flame throwers were tested on humans.
- Humans were tied to sticks and rods and used as targets to test germ-releasing bombs, chemical weapons, and explosive bombs.
- Prisoners were injected with inoculations of disease, disguised as vaccinations, to study their effects.
- To study the effects of untreated venereal diseases, male and female prisoners were deliberately infected with syphilis and gonorrhea, then studied.
- Prisoners were infested with fleas to acquire large quantities of disease-carrying fleas to study the viability of germ warfare.
- Plague fleas, infected clothing, and infected supplies encased in bombs were dropped on various targets.
- The resulting cholera, anthrax, and plague were estimated to have killed around 400,000 Chinese civilians.
- Tularemia was tested on Chinese civilians.
- The Togo Unit employed gruesome tactics to secure specimens of select body organs. If Ishii or one of his co-workers wished to do research on the human brain, then they would order the guards to find them a useful sample. A prisoner would be taken from his cell. Guards would hold him while another guard would smash the victim's head open with an ax. His brain would be extracted off to the pathologist, and then to the crematorium for the usual disposal.
- Some of the experiments had nothing to do with advancing the capability of germ warfare, or of medicine. There is such a thing as professional curiosity: ‘What would happen if we did such and such?’ What medical purpose was served by performing and studying beheadings? None at all. That was just playing around. Professional people, too, like to play."
- Prisoners had limbs (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputated)> in order to study (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Loss).> Limbs removed were sometimes reattached to the opposite side of victims' bodies. Some prisoners had their stomachs surgically removed and their (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus)> reattached to the intestines. Parts of organs, such as the brain, lungs, and liver, were removed from others.(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-dissect-27)>
- (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_(disease))-infected> (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flea),> bred in the laboratories of Unit 731 and Unit 1644, were spread by low-flying airplanes over Chinese cities, including coastal (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo)> and (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changde),> (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan)> Province, in 1940 and 1941.(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-ciadoc-6)> These operations killed tens of thousands with (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague)> epidemics. An expedition to (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing)> involved spreading (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid)> and (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratyphoid)> germs into the (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well),> (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh),> and houses of the city, as well as infusing them in snacks distributed to locals. Epidemics broke out shortly after, to the elation of many researchers, who concluded that (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratyphoid_fever)> was "the most effective" of the pathogens.(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-32)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-Barenblatt2004-33):> xii, 173
- At least 12 large-scale bioweapon field trials were carried out, and at least 11 Chinese cities attacked with biological agents. An attack on (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changde)> in 1941 reportedly led to approximately 10,000 biological casualties and 1,700 deaths among ill-prepared Japanese troops, in most cases due to cholera.(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-histpersp-4)> Japanese researchers performed tests on prisoners with (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague),> (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera),> (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox),> (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulism),> and other diseases.(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-34)> This research led to the development of the (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defoliation_bacilli_bomb)> and the flea bomb used to spread bubonic plague.(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-35)> Some of these bombs were designed with (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcelain)> shells, an idea proposed by Ishii in 1938.
- To determine the best course of treatment for varying degrees of shrapnel wounds sustained on the field by Japanese Soldiers, Chinese prisoners were exposed to direct bomb blasts. They were strapped, unprotected, to wooden planks that were staked into the ground at increasing distances around a bomb that was then detonated. It was surgery for most, autopsies for the rest.
- n other tests, subjects were deprived of food and water to determine the length of time until death; placed into low-pressure chambers until their eyes popped from the sockets; experimented upon to determine the relationship between temperature, burns, and human survival; hung upside down until death; crushed with heavy objects; electrocuted; dehydrated with hot fans;(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-48)> placed into (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifuge)> and spun until death; injected with animal blood, notably with horse blood; exposed to lethal doses of (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray);> subjected to various chemical weapons inside gas chambers; injected with seawater; and burned or buried alive.(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-49)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-aiipowmia-50)> In addition to chemical agents, the properties of many different toxins were also investigated by the Unit. To name a few, prisoners were exposed to tetrodotoxin (pufferfish or fugu venom), heroin, Korean bindweed, bactal, and castor-oil seeds (ricin).(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-51)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-52)> Massive amounts of blood were drained from some prisoners in order to study the effects of blood loss according to former Unit 731 vivisectionist Okawa Fukumatsu. In one case, at least half a liter of blood was drawn at two-to-three-day intervals.(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-53)>
- Takeo Wano, a former medical worker in Unit 731, said that he saw a Western man, who was vertically cut into two pieces, pickled in a jar of (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde).(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-Kristor-55)> Wano guessed that the man was Russian because there were many Russians living in the area at that time.(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-Kristor-55)>
- one experiment documented the time it took for three-day-old babies to freeze to death.(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-56)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-57)>
- Army Engineer Hisato Yoshimura conducted experiments by taking captives outside, dipping various appendages into water of varying temperatures, and allowing the limb to freeze.(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-59)> Once frozen, Yoshimura would strike their affected limbs with a short stick, "emitting a sound resembling that which a board gives when it is struck".(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-Kristor-55)> Ice was then chipped away, with the affected area being subjected to various treatments, such as being doused in water, exposed to the heat of fire, etc.
- Yoshimura developed a "resistance index of frostbite" based on the mean temperature 5 to 30 minutes after immersion in freezing water, the temperature of the first rise after immersion, and the time until the temperature first rises after immersion. In a number of separate experiments it was then determined how these parameters depend on the time of day a victim's body part was immersed in freezing water, the surrounding temperature and humidity during immersion, how the victim had been treated before the immersion ("after keeping awake for a night", "after hunger for 24 hours", "after hunger for 48 hours", "immediately after heavy meal", "immediately after hot meal", "immediately after muscular exercise", "immediately after cold bath", "immediately after hot bath"), what type of food the victim had been fed over the five days preceding the immersions with regard to dietary nutrient intake ("high protein (of animal nature)", "high protein (of vegetable nature)", "low protein intake", and "standard diet"), and salt intake (45 g NaCl per day, 15 g NaCl per day, no salt).(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-65)>
- Infection of venereal disease by injection was abandoned, and the researchers started forcing the prisoners into sexual acts with each other. Four or five unit members, dressed in white laboratory clothing completely covering the body with only eyes and mouth visible, rest covered, handled the tests. A male and female, one infected with syphilis, would be brought together in a cell and forced into sex with each other. It was made clear that anyone resisting would be shot.(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-66)>
- After victims were infected, they were vivisected at different stages of infection, so that internal and external organs could be observed as the disease progressed. Testimony from multiple guards blames the female victims as being hosts of the diseases, even as they were forcibly infected. Genitals of female prisoners that were infected with syphilis were called "jam-filled buns" by guards.(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-gold-testimony-67)>
- Female prisoners were forced to become pregnant for use in experiments. The hypothetical possibility of vertical transmission (from mother to child) of diseases, particularly syphilis, was the stated reason for the torture. Fetal survival and damage to mother's reproductive organs were objects of interest. Though "a large number of babies were born in captivity", there have been no accounts of any survivors of Unit 731, children included. It is suspected that the children of female prisoners were killed after birth or aborted.(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-gold-testimony-67)>
- No one who entered Unit 731 came out alive. Prisoners were usually received into Unit 731 at night in motor vehicles painted black with a ventilation hole but no windows.(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-83)> The vehicle would pull up at the main gates and one of the drivers would go to the guardroom and report to the guard. That guard would then telephone to the "Special Team" in the inner-prison (Shiro Ishii's brother was head of this Special Team).(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-auto2-84)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-85)> Then, the prisoners would be transported through a secret tunnel dug under the facade of the central building to the inner-prisons.(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-86)> One of the prisons housed women and children (Building 8), while the other prison housed men (Building 7). Once at the inner-prison, technicians would take samples of the prisoners' blood and stool, test their kidney function, and collect other physical data.(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-87)> Once deemed healthy and fit for experimentation, prisoners lost their names and were given a three-digit number, which they retained until their death. Whenever prisoners died after the experiments they had been subjected to, a clerk of the 1st Division struck their numbers off an index card and took the deceased prisoner's manacles to be put on new arrivals to the prison.(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-88)>
