# Atlantis
- The archetypical lost world, the sunken City of Atlantis was conjured up by Plato himself in two of his dialogues. The Greek philosopher mocked him for the grandiosity he attributed to the Bronze Age continent (contemporary historian Theopompus even made up another fictional island, Meropis, as a parody of Atlantis). He sketched a highly sophisticated civilisation comprised of several concentric islands, founded by demigods and rich in exotic fauna and flora. Plato also described the nation’s downfall. When the people there grew too hubristic, the ocean swallowed the land whole, though that doesn’t prevent it from having a prominent hold over mankind’s imagination to this day.
