# Gudiao (蛊雕)
- A Chinese mythical bird listed in the Southern Mountain  
	Chapter of _Shan Hai Jing_, the Gudiao is similar to a condor but also  
	noticeably different. It is horned, man-eating, and with an awful shriek  
	like that of a human baby. In short, this is one mythological creature few  
	people would want to meet.
