# Jamaican Jerk Seasoning
- Perfect for summer grilling season, jerk refers to prepping meat with a wet or dry rub. We've heavily packed this blend with Jamaican allspice berries, black peppercorns, and dried thyme, for a flavorful, spicy kick. Use to create a jerk paste for marinating chops, ribs or chicken.
