- The numbering, tingly heat plus the citrus flavor of Sichuan peppercorns tends to sneak up on your taste buds slowlycreating an effect known as ma la, or 'numbing heat'. Not really a peppercorn but a berry from the Chinese prickly ash tree, use in classic Sichuan dishes or add to burgers, lamb, noodle salads, tofu or stir-fries, just to name a few.
