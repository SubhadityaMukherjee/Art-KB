# Trans-fixed by Chris Burden
- Chris Burden was one at the fore of so-called "danger pieces." This included Shoot (video) where, in 1971, Burden had an assistant in a gallery shoot him with a rifle. But Trans-fixed was Burden's most captivating, dichotomous work. For the action, Burden was crucified to the back of a Volkswagen Beetle, though his initial performance was summarily brief-it's said Burden performed the action, the car was wheeled out of a garage for two minutes, with the engine revved, for the infamous photograph to be snapped, and then the car pushed back in.
