# One Year Performance (Time Clock Piece) by Tehching Hsieh
- Tehching "Sam" Hsieh staged five of his one-year performances in the 1970s and '80s, including voluntarily incarcerating himself, not entering any type of shelter, and consuming or producing no cultural works whatsoever. While his "ordeals" were largely about deprivation, perhaps his most meaningful was One Year Performance 1980-1981 (Time Clock Piece), where Hsieh punched a time clock in his studio every hour on the hour for an entire year. The Time Clock Piece is thought to have bridged a gap between industry and art in a way particular to the individual that Warhol's grand factory pieces couldn't achieve.
