# Taliyakud
- chief god of the underworld who tends a fire between two tree trunks
- asks the souls of the dead questions, where the soul's louse acts as the conscience that answers the questions truthfully
- if the soul is wicked, it is pitched and burned, but if it is good, it passes on to a happier place with abundant food
