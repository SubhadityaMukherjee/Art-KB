# Fengsheng Shou (风生兽)
- A leopard-like Chinese mythical creature with a  
	nearly impregnable hide. It could be killed by repeatedly striking its  
	head, but upon wind entering its mouth, would instantly be revived. (Thus  
	'fengsheng,' which means wind-born). Described in ancient texts such as  
	_Baopuzi_, it is said that humans can gain half a millennium of life from  
	ingesting the brain of a Fengsheng Shou together with Chrysanthemum.
