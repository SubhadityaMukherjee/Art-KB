# Namtogan
- the paraplegic god of good fortune whose presence made rice harvests and community livestock bountiful
- when the humans he was staying with at Ahin began neglecting the Bulul), he left, causing a curse of misfortunes
- the people persuaded him to return, where he responded by teaching the people how to create bululs and how to do the rituals for the statues, effectively lifting the curse
