# Hei Bai Wu Chang 
- Translated as “the Impermanence of Black and White,” Hei Bai Wu Chang is a duo of ghastly hellish officers responsible for capturing sinful souls, rewarding the virtuous, and punishing the wicked. Their signature traits are their long tongues. Some folkloric beliefs also consider them as Chinese gods of wealth, with both officers honored and prayed to during annual [Chinese Ghost Festival](https://holidappy.com/holidays/chinese-ghost-festival-origins-facts) celebrations.
