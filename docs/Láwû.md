# Láwû
- a giant creature similar to a mixture of a bird, a serpent, and a crocodile who seeks to swallow Aldó and Búlan
- the soul of Dápu who does her bidding as Dápu has been weakened when her belly burst
- in another, less common, version, Láwû is the ghost of Dápu
- while in another, Láwû is the descendant of Dápu, seeking revenge for the deity's mother
