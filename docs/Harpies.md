# Harpies

- Harpies are mythical creatures in Greek and Roman mythologies with the head of a woman and the body of a vulture (although some myths suggest exactly the opposite).
- The word 'harpy' is considered to be derived from the Greek word _harpyia_ meaning 'the one that steals'. This is thought to be the reason why these creatures were given the name.
- In Greek mythology, harpies were [Zeus](Zeus.md)â€™ servants and one of the most significant myths about harpies have them punishing the King of Thrace, Phineus.
- [Zeus](Zeus.md) wanted to punish Phineus since he used his talent for prophecy to disclose secrets of gods. He ordered harpies to steal whatever food was put in front of him.
- His punishment went on until Jason and the Argonauts came to his rescue on the island where he lived.
