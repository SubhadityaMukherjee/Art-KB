# Shelob

- Spiders in the Lord of the Rings – and Tolkien’s work generally – are nightmare-inducing. Imagine seeing a black widow. Pretty scary, right? Now, imagine seeing one that’s, like, five times your size. That’s Shelob, a giant spider living in the tunnels known as Torech Ungol, a passageway to Mordor above Minas Morgul, leading to Cirith Ungol.
- The tunnels are an impossible labyrinth in which Shelob hunts down and eats anything that tries to pass through them. Frodo was lucky that she likes to 'play' with her food before eating it, keeping them alive and the heart beating as she devours them. That gave Samwise enough time to save Frodo and force Shelob back into her tunnels.
- Interestingly, Shelob is a direct descendant of Ungoliant, a spider that was much larger, and unmeasurably more powerful, but I’ll get to that later.
