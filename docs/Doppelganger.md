# Doppelganger

- Doppelgangers are the legendary creatures that were told to be the double spirits of people.
- Although they looked exactly the same with the person in question, doppelgangers were not the twins of those people.
- According to the belief, doppelgangers had no reflections in the mirror or cast shadows.
- Seeing a doppelganger was considered a bad omen.
- Noah Brooks suggested in his book _Washington in Lincolnâ€™s Time_ that Abraham Lincoln saw his doppelganger and his wife told him that he would not live to serve his second term as the president of USA. Lincoln was killed right after he was chosen to be the president for a second term.
- Also, John Dunne, the famous English poet said he saw the doppelganger of his wife when he was in Paris. He came back home to find out that his wife gave birth to a stillborn baby.
