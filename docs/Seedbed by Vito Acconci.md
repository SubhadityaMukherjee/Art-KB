# Seedbed by Vito Acconci
- Seedbed was revolutionary for its abundant and blatant sexual content. The artist lay under a slight wooden plank that extended from the floor to the wall at a slant. He then lay beneath with a microphone, relaying his sexual fantasies of the audience members who walked above him, while vigorously masturbating. His fantasies and murmurings, like "You're ramming your cock down into my ass," could be heard throughout loudspeakers in the gallery.
