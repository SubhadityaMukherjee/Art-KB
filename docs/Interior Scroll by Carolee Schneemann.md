# Interior Scroll by Carolee Schneemann
- Carolee Schneemann is argued to have realigned the gender balance of conceptual and minimal art with her 1975 piece, Interior Scroll, by emphasizing her vagina as the source of artistic power. The crux of the piece was Schneemann extracting a feminist discourse from her vagina and reading it to the audience, as she stood naked on a table. Prior to this, she entered the room in a sheet and an apron, disrobed, lay on the table, painted an outline of herself, and then read from her book, Cezanne, She Was a Great Painter.
