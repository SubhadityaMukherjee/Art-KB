# Punk Prayer by Pussy Riot
- Pussy Riot ignited an international firestorm with their performance of their Punk Prayer in February 2012. Five members of the some 11-person collective entered Moscow's Cathedral of Christ The Savior and staged a performance of shouts, dances, and guitar. The action was in opposition to the national church's continued support for President Vladimir Putin. Though the group was purported to be somewhat reviled for the actions in their home nation, Western audiences rallied with cries of "Free Pussy Riot" after three of the performers were arrested for "hooliganism" and imprisoned for the crime that prosecutors said was motivated by religious hatred. The group maintains it was a political act. On August 17 2012, the three arrested were sentenced to two years each in penal colonies; two of the performers are still incarcerated.
