# Testicle Banquet by Mao Sugiyama
- Mao Sugiyama caused a scandal with his performance art in Japan. Sugiyama, who identifies as asexual, underwent elective genital-removal surgery and then had his genitals cooked and served at an upscale dinner party. Five paying guests were allowed to taste the severed penis, testicles, and scrotal skin, which were seasoned with parsley and served alongside mushrooms. Although Sugiyama carefully followed all Japanese laws, he was later charged with indecent exposure. Sugiyama said the performance was meant to raise awareness about 'sexual minorities, x-gender, asexual people.' View photos of the meal here (warning: the content is as graphic as it sounds).
