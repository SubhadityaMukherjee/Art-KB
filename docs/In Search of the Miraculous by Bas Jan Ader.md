# In Search of the Miraculous by Bas Jan Ader
- Bas Jan Aderâ€™s famous last piece is somewhat of a mystery. After a career of artistry in photography, film, and performance, the Dutch artist disappeared at sea in 1975 during his performance In Search of the Miraculous, in which he aimed to cross the North Atlantic from Massachusetts, USA, to Falmouth, England. He estimated that the journey would take him about two and a half months, but Ader lost radio contact after just three weeks. His boat was found empty ten months later. Whether it was his intention to commit suicide or his death was purely an accident is still unknown.
