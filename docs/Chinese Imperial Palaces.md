# Chinese Imperial Palaces
- The long Chinese feudal society saw the construction of numerous palaces, built to satisfy the emperors' extravagant lifestyles and protect the stateliness of their reign. Served as the venue where public affairs were dealt with and where the royal family lived, the construction of palaces emphasized on the splendorous appearance and regular layout.
- From the E'pang Palace of the Qin Dynasty (221BC-206BC), Weiyang Palace of the Han Dynasty (206BC-220) to the Forbidden City of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the scale of Chinese imperial palaces became larger and larger.
- Most of them are axial symmetrical, with splendid buildings standing at the middle axis and smaller attached houses located along both sides.
