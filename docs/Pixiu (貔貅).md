# Pixiu (貔貅)
- A hybrid Chinese mythical creature resembling a winged lion,  
	the Pixiu is one of the most beloved symbols of wealth in Chinese Feng Shui  
	practices. According to legend, the Pixiu only eats gold, silver, and  
	jewels, and has no rectum, thus whatever wealth it ingests will never be  
	expelled. Feng Shui practitioners further differentiate between the male  
	and female Pixiu, with the female Pixiu said to be capable of deflecting  
	misfortune.
