# Fenghuang (凤凰)
- Often equated with the phoenix, the Chinese Fenghuang was  
	originally a pair, with _Feng_ being the male and _Huang_ being the female.  
	Synonymous with prosperity and blissful unions, the Fenghuang is till  
	today, one of the most popular Chinese auspicious symbols. Occasionally, it  
	also replaces the Rooster in the Chinese Zodiac.
