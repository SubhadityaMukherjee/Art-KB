# Apung Iru (Lord of the River)
- was depicted as gigantic cosmic crocodile that supported the earth on its back, and was located under the great World River. If angered, Apung Iru caused the rivers to flood
- hence, this is the origin of libad or the water procession during the full moon nearest to the summer solstice, which takes place in the yearly celebration called Bayung Danum (New Water) to appease the deity.
