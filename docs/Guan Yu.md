# Guan Yu 
- Guan Yu was a sworn-brother of Liu Bei, one of the three faction leaders of the tumultuous Three Kingdoms Era of China. Deeply respected for his loyalty and honor, progressive deification in subsequent centuries resulted in Guan Yu now being one of the most venerated Chinese deities in both Taoism and Chinese Buddhism. Worshippers also typically refer to Guan Yu as Guan Gong  or Guan Er Ge , and see him as the personification of brotherly honor. Lastly, in the western world, Guan Yu is sometimes described as the Chinese god of war.
