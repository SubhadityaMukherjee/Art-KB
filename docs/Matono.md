# Matono
- a brave woman who adventured into the underworld and saw the causes of poor crops and earthquakes
- she afterwards reported her studies to the people of the earth
- during the kosdÃ«y, the people pray to her to not permit the rice, camotes, and other things to grow down, but to cause them to grow up
