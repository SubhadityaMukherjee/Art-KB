# Yard by Allan Kaprow
- Allan Kaprow, an abstract-expressionist turned installation artist, coined the term "happenings" in the late '50s, alongside contemporaries (and friends) John Cage and Robert Rauschenberg. His first happenings engaged the audience in overwhelming, often playful ways. Yard is perhaps the most significant of these early works, consisting of rooms full of rubber tires over which audience members jumped and forms covered in tarpaper audience members had to crawl through. For Kaprow, a former action painter, the action was as important as the paint. "Life is much more interesting than art. The line between art and life should be kept as fluid, and perhaps indistinct, as possible," he once wrote.
