# Cockaigne
- First popping up in 12th-century folktales before being committed to writing in 1250, the foodie abundance of Cockaigne – where cheeses rain from the sky and wine flows in streams – makes it endear. Even with our lives now immeasurably more comfortable than those of medieval peasants (who you can imagine could do with some daydreaming while ploughing through muddy fields), we still know about the most widespread idea of Utopia from 800 years ago. It’s a place where geese roast themselves, and rooves are made of bacon. It’s also where sexual freedom outdoes the Summer of Love, and sleeping is a well-paid job.
