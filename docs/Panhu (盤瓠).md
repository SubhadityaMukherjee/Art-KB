# Panhu (盤瓠)
- A divine hound in the folktales of Southern China. According  
	to _Soushen Ji_, Panhu was originally a worm, extracted from the ear of an  
	old woman in Emperor Ku’s court. After the old woman placed the worm into a  
	gourd, it transformed into a magical hound with five colors. Subsequently,  
	Panhu assisted the imperial court in suppressing a rebellion and was given  
	the princess’ hand as reward. Today, Panhu is considered the mythological  
	ancestor of China’s Yao and She minority tribes. Some versions also  
	describe Panhu as having a human body, but with the head of a hound.
