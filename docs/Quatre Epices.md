# Quatre Epices
- There’s a saying, simplicity is the ultimate in sophistication. Never is that truer than in the case of this little gem. This blend dates back to the European courts of the middle ages and is a staple in French and Middle Eastern kitchens, often used in pâtés and terrines. This with braised short ribs, rubbed salmon, roasted carrots or baked cakes and muffins for complex flavor.
