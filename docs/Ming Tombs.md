# Ming Tombs
- A Chinese imperial mausoleum usually consists of two parts, the divine road and the burial palace. The marble archway or paifang is the beginning of the divine road and of the whole Ming Tombs. This carved archway is the largest existent one in China. It bears patterns of clouds and dragons, which is a characteristic of imperial architecture.
- The divine road is a passage in front of the tombs to facilitate the sacrificial ceremonies. The two hexagon stone pillars are the sign of a divine road. Behind the engraved pillars are 24 stone animals
- They are four horses, four legendary animals called qilin, four elephants, four camels, four legendary animals called xiezhi, and four lions. 
- Behind the stone animals are 12 stone figures. Each of these life like statues is carved out of a whole rock. Stone figures and animals along the divine road serve as guardians and waiters, and the animals are employed to rid evil spirits and symbolize peace
