# Pumpkin Pie Spices
- Crafted with naturally organic, freshly ground whole cinnamon, allspice, black peppercorns and star anise, this pumpkin pie spice blend is unlike all those other traditional blends. Sprinkle this pumpkin spice over squash and roast, stir into yogurt or ice cream or brew into your morning coffee or add to cookies, bread, cakes, pies or other baked goods.
