# Liu Er Mi Hou (六耳猕猴)
- The 'Six-Eared Macaque' is arguably the most  
	dangerous antagonist in _Journey to the West_. This deceptive creature  
	impersonated Su Wukong after the Monkey King abandoned his pilgrimage  
	following a tiff with Tripitaka, with the impersonation so perfect, only  
	Gautama Buddha and Diting (see above could see through the pretense.  
	Gautama Buddha later also listed the Six-Eared Macaque as one of Four  
	Magical Monkeys. Su Wukong himself was one of this quartet, which was why  
	the Six-Eared Macaque had powers similar to his.
