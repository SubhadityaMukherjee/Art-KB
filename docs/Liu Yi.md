# Liu Yi 
- Philologist Liu Yi chanced upon the suffering Third [Dragon](Dragon.md) Princess at Lake Dong Ting. After learning of her plight, he assisted with informing her family, who then dispatched a massive army to free the princess. Because of this kindness, the princess fell in love with Liu Yi, but out of guilt over the princess’ abusive husband dying in the conflict, Liu Yi rejected her love. Thankfully, the princess’ uncle intervened and the couple ultimately married.
