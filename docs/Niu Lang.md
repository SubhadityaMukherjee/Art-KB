# Niu Lang 
- Niu Lang means “cowherd” and was a human who fell in love with the immortal Zhi Nü i.e. weaver girl. As their romance was forbidden, they were banished to opposite ends of the Milky Way, permitted to only meet once a year on a magical bridge of magpies. In astrology, Niu Lang represents the star Altair while Zhi Nü is the star Vega. Lastly, this classic folktale is also widely known in other parts of East Asia. For example, in Japan, it is known as Tanabata.
1# Qi Xian Nü 
- The “Seventh Fairy” was a heavenly weaver who was moved by [Dong Yong](Dong%20Yong.md.md)’s self-sacrificing filial piety. After magically assisting him to free himself from slavery, Qi Xian Nü married [Dong Yong](Dong%20Yong.md.md) and lived with him in the mortal world, till forced to return to heaven. Many Chinese consider the tale of [Dong Yong](Dong%20Yong.md.md) and Qi Xian Nü to be an alternate version of The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.
