# Ao (鳌)
- An ancient giant tortoise that supports mountains and continents,  
	the legs of which, supposedly, were also used by the goddess Nüwa to hold  
	up the heavens. In the _Huainanzi Treatise_, it is said that an Ao carries  
	the Taoist magical mountains of Penglai, Fangzhang, and Yingzhou on its  
	back.
