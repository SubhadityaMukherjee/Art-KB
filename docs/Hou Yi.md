# Hou Yi
- Hou Yi was a mythical archer in Ancient China, and there are starkly different stories when it comes to his deeds. Regardless of version, though, Hou Yi’s tale began with him tasked by King Yao to deal with the ten suns scorching the world. Hou Yi successfully shot down nine of these suns, after which he either needed an elixir of immortality to restore himself or was given one as reward. Whichever the development, Hou Yi’s wife [Chang’e](Chang%E2%80%99e.md.md) then ended up ingesting the elixir instead, and ascended to the moon as an immortal, forever separated from her beloved husband. In memory of their story, the Chinese celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival, with the act of placing [mooncakes](https://delishably.com/world-cuisine/mooncake-facts) and food before the full moon a reflection of Hou Yi’s eternal longing for his wife.
