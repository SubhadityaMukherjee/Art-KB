# Parvati

- Parvati is the Hindu mother goddess who presides over energy, creativity, marriage, and motherhood. She is the wife of Shiva, and together with Lakshmi and Saraswati, she forms the Tridevi. The Tridevi is the female counterpart of the Trimurti, formed by the wives of these gods.
- Apart from that, Parvati also has connections with childbirth, love, beauty, fertility, devotion, and divine strength. Parvati has over 1000 names since each one of her attributes received one. Since she is the wife of Shiva, she became an important part of Shaivaism. Most depictions show Parvati as a mature and beautiful woman accompanying her husband.
