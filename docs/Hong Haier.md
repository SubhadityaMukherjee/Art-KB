# Hong Haier 
- The immensely powerful son of [Niu Mo Wang](Niu%20Mo%20Wang.md.md), born with the ability to manipulate all forms of fire. Even the mighty [Sun Wukong](Sun%20Wukong.md.md) wasnâ€™t a match for him and had to enlist the help of [Guan Yin](Guan%20Yin.md.md). After [Guan Yin](Guan%20Yin.md.md) subdued him with a rigged lotus, the demon child was transfigured into Shan Cai Tongzi, the Buddhist Child Propagator of Wealth.
