# Hong Haier 
- The immensely powerful son of [[Niu Mo Wang.md]], born with the ability to manipulate all forms of fire. Even the mighty [[Sun Wukong.md]] wasnâ€™t a match for him and had to enlist the help of [[Guan Yin.md]]. After [[Guan Yin.md]] subdued him with a rigged lotus, the demon child was transfigured into Shan Cai Tongzi, the Buddhist Child Propagator of Wealth.
