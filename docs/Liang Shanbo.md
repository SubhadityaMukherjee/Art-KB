# Liang Shanbo 
- The male protagonist of the famous Butterfly Lovers story, Liang was a bookworm who completely failed to notice his “sworn brother” and study partner was a lady i.e. Zhu Yingtai. When he did find out, he fell head over heels in love with Zhu, but could not marry her as she was already betrothed. Wallowing in grief, his health then deteriorated and he eventually died. Later, when passing by Liang’s grave during her wedding procession, Zhu begged heaven to open the grave, thereafter throwing herself into the pit when the wish was granted. Their spirits then emerged from the grave as a pair of inseparable butterflies, giving rise to the common name of the story.
