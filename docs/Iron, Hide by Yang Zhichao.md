# Iron, Hide by Yang Zhichao
- Yang Zhichao uses his work to bring attention to the relationship between the body and the world. In Iron, Hide, Zhichao, with the help of artist Ai Weiwei, went through a public operation in which a metal object was permanently inserted into his leg. In his next two works, Planting [Grass](docs/Grass.md) and Earth,Zhichao implanted natural objects into his body. In both instances, the natural objects were rejected by his body, which festered with infections, whereas the metal object was adopted into his body without a problem. His artwork challenges notions of humanityâ€™s connection to the natural and technological worlds.
