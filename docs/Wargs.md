# Wargs

- Wargs are those hideous creatures that Orcs and Goblins usually ride. They look like giant wolves, and their size and head shape allows a distinction between the species. Wargs are quite intelligent, which allows them to be saddled like horses, unlike their wolven relatives.
- The species is incredibly muscular, heavy, and strong, with sharp teeth and a brain that allows them to attack on command, not just hunt for food. We’ve seen them in The Fellowship of the Ring when they attacked the group near Moria, and in The Two Towers, when they attacked the convoy retreating from Edoras to Helm’s Deep.
- They also appeared briefly during The Siege of Minas Tirith in The Return of the King, most notably at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Finally, we’ve seen wargs in battle during The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, when Azog and his Orc army used wargs to push Gandalf, Thorin, and the Dwarves to the edge of a cliff, and up the trees.
