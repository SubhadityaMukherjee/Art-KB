# Acheri

- Acheri is a mythical creature in Native American folklore which is believed to be a revenge spirit. According to the belief, Acheri is a ghost of a young girl that died a terrible death either by being murdered or by being left to die after being abused.
- Wandering around mountainsides, Acheri comes down at night to spread death especially among children by making them sick.
- Casting its shadow is enough for acheri to make children sick. Although it is a revenge spirit, it does not target specific individuals and very rarely adult people.
- It is believed to lure some children back to its home in some cases.
- Wearing red clothes, bracelets or necklaces is said to provide protection against Acheri.
