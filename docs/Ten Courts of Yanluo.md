# Ten Courts of Yanluo
- The concept of the "Ten Courts of Yanluo" began after Chinese_folk_religionwas influenced by Buddhism. In Chinese mythology, the Jade_Emperor put the Hell King Yama_(Buddhism)in charge of overseeing the affairs of Diyu.
- There are 12,800 hells located under the earth – eight dark hells, eight cold hells and 84,000 miscellaneous hells located at the edge of the universe. All will go to Diyu after death but the period of time one spends in Diyu is not forever – it depends on the severity of the sins one committed. After receiving due punishment, one will eventually be sent for Reincarnation. In the meantime, souls pass from stage to stage at the decision of Yanwang (閻王). Yama also reduced the number of hells to ten. He divided Diyu into ten courts, each overseen by a Yanwang, while he remained as the sovereign ruler of Diyu
- Some religious or literature books say that wrongdoers who were not punished when they were alive are punished in the hells after death. Sinners feel pain and agony just like living humans when they are subjected to the tortures listed below. They cannot "die" from the torture because when the ordeal is over, their bodies will be restored to their original states for the torture to be repeated
- The eighteen hells vary from narrative to narrative but some commonly mentioned tortures include: being steamed
- being fried in oil cauldrons
- being sawed into half
- being run over by vehicles
