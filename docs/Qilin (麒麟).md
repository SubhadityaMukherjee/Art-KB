# Qilin (麒麟)
- Also known as the Kirin, the Chinese Qilin is an auspicious  
	beast with the body of a steed, and the horns and other features of a  
	dragon. Its appearance announces the arrival of a sage or enlightened  
	ruler, and in Taoism, the Qilin also punishes the wicked. Within Chinese  
	art, the Qilin is one of the most widely used decorative motifs, a  
	popularity that has over the centuries influenced Japanese, Korean, Thai,  
	and even Vietnamese art. Lastly, the 2022 Wizarding World movie _Fantastic  
	Beasts
- The Secrets of Dumbledore_ described Qilin as capable of  
	identifying the pure in heart. They will only bow to those truly worthy of  
	leadership.
