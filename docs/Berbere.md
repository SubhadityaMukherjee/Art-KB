# Berbere
- Arguably the most famous spice blend of Ethiopian cuisine, this Bird's Eye Berbere is smoky, spicy and complex. This spice mix is traditionally used in nearly all Ethiopian dishes but particularly shines in stews and on meats and poultry. Also try as a rub on roast chicken, roast vegetables or stir into oil and vinegar as a dip.
