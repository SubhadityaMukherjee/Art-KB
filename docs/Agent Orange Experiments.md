# Agent Orange Experiments

- Prisoners, like people of color, have often been the unwilling objects of evil experiments. From 1965 to 1966, Dr. Albert Kligman, funded by Dow Chemical, Johnson & Johnson, and the U.S. Army, conducted what was deemed 'dermatological research' on approximately 75 prisoners. What was actually being studied was the effects of Agent Orange on humans.
- Prisoners were injected with dioxin (a toxic byproduct of Agent Orange)—468 times the amount the study originally called for. The results were prisoners with volcanic eruptions of chloracne (severe acne combined with blackheads, cysts, pustules, and other really bad stuff) on the face, armpits and groin. Long after the experiments ended, prisoners continued to suffer from the effects of the exposure. Dr. Kligman, apparently very enthusiastic about the study, was quoted as saying, 'All I saw before me were acres of skin… It was like a farmer seeing a fertile field for the first time.' Kligman went on to become the doctor behind Retin-A, a major treatment for acne.
