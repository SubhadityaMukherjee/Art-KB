# Tu Di 
- Tu Di is not one god but the generic title for a whole host of earth spirits/guardians. They are invariably depicted as small-sized elderly men too. In _Journey to the West_, [[Sun Wukong.md]] always summons the local Tu Di upon reaching an unfamiliar place.
1# Wen Chang 
- The Chinese God of Culture, Literature, and Learning.
1# Yue Lao 
- The “Old Man of the Moon” is the Chinese God of Marriage. He connects couples with a magical red thread.
1# Zao Jun 
- The Chinese God of the Kitchen. It is said that he always returns to the Heavenly Court to submit his annual reports seven days before [Chinese New Year](https://holidappy.com/holidays/Top-Five-Chinese-New-Year-Stories-and-Legends). This belief, in turn, began the “necessity” of cleaning the household before that date so as to avoid heavenly chastisement.
1# Zhu Sheng Niang Niang 
- The Chinese Goddess of Childbirth and Fertility. Worship of her is common in Fujian and Taiwan.
