- 04:57 : What do I really want to show with my art
	- Stories, emotions, feelings

- 04:59 : Alone. But trying
	- Deity in a dark cave. Surrounded by fear. But bright flowers blooming.
	- Chains
	- Hope
	- Sitting in a curled up position
	- Why is she there?
		- Shes too different from everyone else
		- Her powers are not understood
		- She took revenge for her family
			- Drawings on the sand
	- How long has it been?
		- Years
		- Marks on stone?
		- The scars have faded
	- What are the flowers for?
		- Hope
		- Keeps her company
		- Reminds of her family
		- Her mother used to have these flowers
	- What does she want?
		- To be with her family again
		- Not revenge. She does not want to hurt anyone. Shes just misunderstood
