In a number of separate experiments it was then determined how these parameters depend on the time of day a victim&rsquo;s body part was immersed in freezing water, the surrounding temperature and humidity during immersion, how the victim had been treated before the immersion (&ldquo;after keeping awake for a night&rdquo;, &ldquo;after hunger for 24 hours&rdquo;, &ldquo;after hunger for 48 hours&rdquo;, &ldquo;immediately after heavy meal&rdquo;, &ldquo;immediately after hot meal&rdquo;, &ldquo;immediately after muscular exercise&rdquo;, &ldquo;immediately after cold bath&rdquo;, &ldquo;immediately after hot bath&rdquo;), what type of food the victim had been fed over the five days preceding the immersions with regard to dietary nutrient intake (&ldquo;high protein (of animal nature)&rdquo;, &ldquo;high protein (of vegetable nature)&rdquo;, &ldquo;low protein intake&rdquo;, and &ldquo;standard diet&rdquo;), and salt intake (45 g NaCl per day, 15 g NaCl per day, no salt).(<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-65)>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-65)</a></li> <li>Infection of venereal disease by injection was abandoned, and the researchers started forcing the prisoners into sexual acts with each other. Four or five unit members, dressed in white laboratory clothing completely covering the body with only eyes and mouth visible, rest covered, handled the tests. A male and female, one infected with syphilis, would be brought together in a cell and forced into sex with each other. It was made clear that anyone resisting would be shot.(<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-66)>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-66)</a></li> <li>After victims were infected, they were vivisected at different stages of infection, so that internal and external organs could be observed as the disease progressed. Testimony from multiple guards blames the female victims as being hosts of the diseases, even as they were forcibly infected. Genitals of female prisoners that were infected with syphilis were called &ldquo;jam-filled buns&rdquo; by guards.(<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-gold-testimony-67)>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-gold-testimony-67)</a></li> <li>Female prisoners were forced to become pregnant for use in experiments. The hypothetical possibility of vertical transmission (from mother to child) of diseases, particularly syphilis, was the stated reason for the torture. Fetal survival and damage to mother&rsquo;s reproductive organs were objects of interest. Though &ldquo;a large number of babies were born in captivity&rdquo;, there have been no accounts of any survivors of Unit 731, children included. It is suspected that the children of female prisoners were killed after birth or aborted.(<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-gold-testimony-67)>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-gold-testimony-67)</a></li> <li>No one who entered Unit 731 came out alive.

That guard would then telephone to the &ldquo;Special Team&rdquo; in the inner-prison (Shiro Ishii&rsquo;s brother was head of this Special Team).(<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-auto2-84)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-85)>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-auto2-84)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-85)</a> Then, the prisoners would be transported through a secret tunnel dug under the facade of the central building to the inner-prisons.(<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-86)>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-86)</a> One of the prisons housed women and children (Building 8), while the other prison housed men (Building 7). Once at the inner-prison, technicians would take samples of the prisoners&rsquo; blood and stool, test their kidney function, and collect other physical data.(<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-87)>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-87)</a> Once deemed healthy and fit for experimentation, prisoners lost their names and were given a three-digit number, which they retained until their death. Whenever prisoners died after the experiments they had been subjected to, a clerk of the 1st Division struck their numbers off an index card and took the deceased prisoner&rsquo;s manacles to be put on new arrivals to the prison.(<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-88)>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-88)</a></li> </ul> <br> <div class="row wm-article-nav-buttons" role=navigation aria-label=navigation> <div class="wm-article-nav pull-right"> <a href=../Unnamed%20God/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-right"> Next <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden=true></i> </a> <a href=../Unnamed%20God/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Unnamed God </a> </div> <div class=wm-article-nav> <a href=../Ungoliant/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-left"> <i class="fa fa-chevron-left" aria-hidden=true></i> Previous</a><a href=../Ungoliant/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Ungoliant </a> </div> </div> <br> </div> <footer class="container-fluid wm-page-content"> <p>Documentation built with <a href=https://www.mkdocs.org/ >MkDocs</a> using <a href=https://github.com/gristlabs/mkdocs-windmill>Windmill</a> theme by Grist Labs.</p> </footer> </body> </html>
