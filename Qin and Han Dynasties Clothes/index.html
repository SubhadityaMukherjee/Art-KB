The shenyi was still the favored style of dress for the Han people and the Huns alike.</li> <li>A New Kind of Formal Dress, the <a href=/Pao/ class=wikilink>Pao</a> (袍), a Robe Made of Linen, Prevailed.</li> <li>It Was Stipulated That the Third-rank Officials and Above Wore Green Silk Pao and Shenyi, and the Common People Wore White Linen Pao During the Qin Dynasty.</li> <li>The Western Han Dynasty implemented the Shenyi (long coat) system, which featured a cicada-shaped hat, red clothes and twin diamond-shaped collar. In addition, people of that time wore jade articles and red shoes. The frock and skirt were sewn together in the Shenyi_system. Underpants for memorial ceremonies were decorated with black brims, and those for court dress in feudal China were decorated with red brims. All the garments were collectively called as Chanyi (unlined garment). </li> <li>Costumes in the Han Dynasty fell into two categories according to Yijin (one or two pieces making up the front of a Chinese jacket or grown). There were two types of garments: the curving-front unlined garment with buttons deviously down from the collar to the axilla; the straight-front unlined garment with buttons were straightly down from the collar to the lower part. Curving-front garment originated from the Shenyi (long coat) prevalent in the Warring States Period, and was still in use in the Han Dynasty. But few people wore the Shenyi garments during the Eastern Han Dynasty.</li> <li>Wearers must expose underpants&rsquo; collar form , as the collar was big and curving;<br> - Clothes must use white cloth as lining;<br> - The width of sleeve was 0.4 meters;<br> - The blouse had no sleeve; </li> <li>Wearers of fur clothes should have the fur facing outside;<br> - Waistband was very exquisite. Belt hook was made of gold in various lively and interesting animal figures;<br> - The male kept the habitude of wearing walking sabres without blades for decoration only.<br> - Female laborers of the Han Dynasty always wore short jackets and long skirts, and their knees were always decorated with long hanging waistbands. </li> <li>Male laborers often wore jackets and calf-nose trousers with aprons around the garments. Farmers, workers, businessmen and scholars were all in the same dressing style at that time.</li> </ul> <br> <div class="row wm-article-nav-buttons" role=navigation aria-label=navigation> <div class="wm-article-nav pull-right"> <a href=../Qing%20Dynasty%20Clothes/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-right"> Next <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden=true></i> </a> <a href=../Qing%20Dynasty%20Clothes/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Qing Dynasty Clothes </a> </div> <div class=wm-article-nav> <a href=../Qilin%20%28%E9%BA%92%E9%BA%9F%29/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-left"> <i class="fa fa-chevron-left" aria-hidden=true></i> Previous</a><a href=../Qilin%20%28%E9%BA%92%E9%BA%9F%29/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Qilin (麒麟) </a> </div> </div> <br> </div> <footer class="container-fluid wm-page-content"> <p>Documentation built with <a href=https://www.mkdocs.org/ >MkDocs</a> using <a href=https://github.com/gristlabs/mkdocs-windmill>Windmill</a> theme by Grist Labs.</p> </footer> </body> </html>
