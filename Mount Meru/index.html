However, at that time, Java island was floating freely on the ocean, always tumbling and shaking. To stop the island&rsquo;s movement, the gods decided to nail it to the Earth by moving the part of Mahameru in Jambudvipa(India) and attaching it to Java. The resulting mountain is Mount_Semeru the tallest mountain on Java.</li> </ul> <br> <div class="row wm-article-nav-buttons" role=navigation aria-label=navigation> <div class="wm-article-nav pull-right"> <a href=../Mun%20Mai/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-right"> Next <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden=true></i> </a> <a href=../Mun%20Mai/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Mun Mai </a> </div> <div class=wm-article-nav> <a href=../Mount%20Diwata%20Deities/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-left"> <i class="fa fa-chevron-left" aria-hidden=true></i> Previous</a><a href=../Mount%20Diwata%20Deities/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Mount Diwata Deities </a> </div> </div> <br> </div> <footer class="container-fluid wm-page-content"> <p>Documentation built with <a href=https://www.mkdocs.org/ >MkDocs</a> using <a href=https://github.com/gristlabs/mkdocs-windmill>Windmill</a> theme by Grist Labs.</p> </footer> </body> </html>
