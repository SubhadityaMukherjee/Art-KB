What sets Judith Slaying Holofernes apart from other allegorical paintings of the period, however, is that Gentileschi most likely snuck a sneaky portrait into the grisly piece, as the slain Holofernes bears a striking resemblance to Agostino Tassi, a fellow Italian artist who raped Gentileschi when she was 17 years old.","title":"Biblical Revenge"},{"location":"Bifang%20Niao%20%28%E6%AF%95%E6%96%B9%E9%B8%9F%29/","text":"Bifang Niao (\u6bd5\u65b9\u9e1f) A Chinese mythological bird said to be the harbinger of fiery disasters.

Those acts threatened men\u2019s security rather than being associated with sexuality or sexual humiliation. During those \u2018routine procedures\u2019 in camps and ghettos, women suffered not only from men\u2019s unpleasant scrutiny, but also from the fact that men were touching their breasts and genitalia. Some bodily searches for valuables were overt acts of sexual violence. There were also cases of sexualized violence perpetrated with the aim of punishing women for certain wrongdoings and intimidating others. Edmond Baumvald, Holocaust survivor of the Janowska camp in Lviv, recalled that a member of camp leadership forced Jewish newcomers to strip in order to take their possessions. One of the young women refused to do so. For disobedience, he forced her to lift her skirt from behind and then shot her in the genitals. He called up a Jewish man and ordered him to cart her around the square until she died. In some camps and ghettos, women went through forced abortions, sterilizations and medical experiments. Beila Habis, Holocaust survivor from the Bershad camp in Vinnytsia oblast, remembered that women in the camp \u2018had formaldehyde solution injected in utero,\u2019 which caused strong pain and bleeding. In many cases, rape went hand in hand with looting of Jewish properties. In such cases, rape was a method of terror and torture to intimidate women and find out the location of valuables, or the tool of punishment if the offenders failed to get what they came for. Such rapes often took place in Jewish homes or next to them with the woman\u2019s family present. There were also rapes taking place independently of looting. Germans or their collaborators raped women in barracks or in their homes or workplaces. To hide the crime, they would often kill the women afterwards. According to the recollections of Holocaust survivors, Volksdeutsche Florian Koch, who served as a guard in the Bohdanivka camp in Odesa oblast, took teenage girls of ages 17\u201318 from pigsties where they were staying with other Jews, took them to a barn, robbed, raped and shot them. Gang rape was not a rare phenomenon during the Holocaust. Groups of perpetrators would barge into barracks and rape young women right in front of everyone present. Those who resisted could be beaten or killed. Some girls and young women were chosen specifically for sexual abuse. They were selected among permanent residents of ghettos and camps \u2018A Romanian gendarme who was the Commandant of Tulchyn selected healthy young girls from the ghetto and took them away, under the official pretence of working in the kitchen and bakery of those divisions located . The girls returned having been raped and with venereal diseases. Many committed suicide back in the barracks, while some of them were killed when resisting or attempting to flee. Leadership of the ghetto and camps, as well as guards, often took advantage of their position of power and coerced women and girls into sex in exchange for food, medicines, and protection from deportation, or under the threat of killing the women themselves or their loved ones. That way, hungry women agreed to have sex with Chaikovskyi only to be allowed to go to the market and get some food. Some men from camp leadership would hire young girls as house servants, forcing them to provide sexual services. At the same time, some women perceived their body as an important resource to save themselves and their loved ones. Such women could initiate sex with powerful men on their own, which Myrna Goldberg called \u2018sex for survival.\u2019 Parents did everything possible to save their daughters from rape. They would hide them, dress them in rags, hide or cut their hair, smear soot on their faces to make them unattractive, spread rumours about girls suffering from typhoid fever and other diseases. The presence of loved ones during rape was an additional humiliating factor for the survivors of rape. Sexual violence was both a consequence of the dehumanization of Jews and a means of their dehumanization, designed to facilitate the process of killing and to absolve the Nazi murderers and their collaborators from guilt and regret. The drunken men then set loose a dog to rip off the raped woman\u2019s breasts. Blood was everywhere. The woman passed out. The young witness was next. Five soldiers held her down and took turns raping and sodomizing her. They spilled alcohol on her. They laughed. They said they\u2019d kill her. She didn\u2019t yet have breasts for the dog to attack. He points out that the major camps had brothels staffed by prostitutes brought in from the outside to serve officers and guards. He also says that in death camps, women prisoners dropped to as little as 60 pounds and suffered from infectious diseases like typhoid and tuberculosis \u2013 and that the SS would have been careful to stay away from them. \u201cWe usually have people dying to talk, and no one will listen,\u201d she says. \u201cNow we have people dying to listen, but no one will talk.\u201d","title":"docs/Holocaust Women"},{"location":"Holocaust%20Women/#holocaust-women","text":"hair shaving, forced undressing and genital inspection during the Shoah produced feelings and meanings in women that differed from those of men due to socialized gendered roles and expectations.

Conducted only three months after the start of the trial of German Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann, Milgram\u2019s experiment sought to answer the question, \u2018Could it be that Eichmann and his million accomplices in the Holocaust were just following orders?\u2019 In the experiment, two participants (one secretly an actor and one an unwitting test subject) were separated into two rooms where they could hear, but not see, each other. The test subject would then read a series of questions to the actor, punishing each wrong answer with an electric shock. Though many people would indicate their desire to stop the experiment, almost all subjects continued when they were told they would not be held responsible, or that there would not be any permanent damage. Participants were randomly assigned to either the role of prisoner or guard in a simulated prison environment. There were two reserves, and one dropped out, finally leaving ten prisoners and 11 guards. Prisoners were treated like every other criminal, being arrested at their own homes, without warning, and taken to the local police station. They were fingerprinted, photographed and \u2018booked.\u2019 Then they were blindfolded and driven to the psychology department of Stanford University, where Zimbardo had had the basement set out as a prison, with barred doors and windows, bare walls and small cells. Here the deindividuation process began. When the prisoners arrived at the prison they were stripped naked, deloused, had all their personal possessions removed and locked away, and were given prison clothes and bedding. They were issued a uniform, and referred to by their number only. Their clothes comprised a smock with their number written on it, but no underclothes. They also had a tight nylon cap to cover their hair, and a locked chain around one ankle. Guards also wore special sunglasses, to make eye contact with prisoners impossible. Three guards worked shifts of eight hours each (the other guards remained on call). Guards were instructed to do whatever they thought was necessary to maintain law and order in the prison and to command the respect of the prisoners. No physical violence was permitted. The prisoners soon adopted prisoner-like behavior too. They talked about prison issues a great deal of the time. They \u2018told tales\u2019 on each other to the guards. Push-ups were a common form of physical punishment imposed by the guards. One of the guards stepped on the prisoners\u2019 backs while they did push-ups, or made other prisoners sit on the backs of fellow prisoners doing their push-ups. During the second day of the experiment, the prisoners removed their stocking caps, ripped off their numbers, and barricaded themselves inside the cells by putting their beds against the door. The ringleaders of the prisoner rebellion were placed into solitary confinement. After this, the guards generally began to harass and intimidate the prisoners. Privileged prisoners also got to eat special food in the presence of the other prisoners who had temporarily lost the privilege of eating. The effect was to break the solidarity among prisoners. As the prisoners became more submissive, the guards became more aggressive and assertive. They demanded ever greater obedience from the prisoners. The prisoners were dependent on the guards for everything so tried to find ways to please the guards, such as telling tales on fellow prisoners. Less than 36 hours into the experiment, Prisoner # 8612 began suffering from acute emotional disturbance, disorganized thinking, uncontrollable crying, and rage. Soon # 8612 \u2018began to act \u2018crazy,\u2019 to scream, to curse, to go into a rage that seemed out of control.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t until this point that the psychologists realized they had to let him out.

During Milgram\u2019s experiments \u201cteachers\u201d \u2014 Americans recruited for a Yale study they thought was about memory and learning \u2014 were told to read lists of words to \u201clearners\u201d (actors, although the teachers didn\u2019t know that). Each person in the teacher role was instructed to press a lever that would deliver a shock to their \u201clearner\u201d every time he made a mistake on word-matching quizzes. Teachers believed the voltage of shocks increased with each mistake, and ranged from 15 to 450 possible volts; roughly two-thirds of teachers shocked learners to the highest voltage, continuing to deliver jolts at the instruction of the experimenter.

Each person in the teacher role was instructed to press a lever that would deliver a shock to their \u201clearner\u201d every time he made a mistake on word-matching quizzes. Teachers believed the voltage of shocks increased with each mistake, and ranged from 15 to 450 possible volts; roughly two-thirds of teachers shocked learners to the highest voltage, continuing to deliver jolts at the instruction of the experimenter.

Mythologically, it\u2019s connected to a Naiad nymph named Daphne, the beautiful daughter of a river god. In addition to her beauty, she was known for being resolute in her conviction not to marry or be touched by a man in her lifetime. When the god Apollo relentlessly pursued her, she prayed to the river god, Peneus, to free her from Apollo\u2019s affection. So, he used his powers of eternal youth and immortality to transform Daphne into a laurel tree.","title":"Penelope"},{"location":"Penghou%20%28%E5%BD%AD%E4%BE%AF%29/","text":"Penghou (\u5f6d\u4faf) A murderous tree spirit mentioned in Soushen Ji .

Biesenbach also provided the title for the performance, which referred to the fact that during the entire performance \u201cthe artist would be right there in the gallery or the museum.\u201d During the run of the exhibition, Abramovi\u0107 performed The Artist Is Present, a 736-hour and 30-minute static, silent piece, in which she sat immobile in the museum\u2019s atrium while spectators were invited to take turns sitting opposite her. Ulay made a surprise appearance at the opening night of the show. Abramovi\u0107 sat in a rectangle drawn with tape in the floor of the second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her sitting in a chair and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramovi\u0107. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less, a few sat with her for an entire day. The line attracted no attention from museum security until the last day of the exhibition, when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovi\u0107, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovi\u0107 wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovi\u0107 sat across from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed, Alan Rickman, Jemima Kirke, Jennifer Carpenter and Bj\u00f6rk; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramovi\u0107 concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.","title":"The Artist is present"},{"location":"The%20Artist%20is%20present/#the-artist-is-present","text":"From March 14 to May 31, 2010, the Museum of Modern Art held a major retrospective and performance recreation of Abramovi\u0107\u2019s work, the biggest exhibition of performance art in MoMA\u2019s history, curated by Klaus Biesenbach.

Vivisections were conducted on detainees after infecting them with various diseases. Scientists performed invasive surgery on prisoners, removing organs to study the effects of disease on the human body. The experiments were conducted while the patients were alive because it was feared that the decomposition process would affect the results. Human targets were used to test grenades positioned at various distances and in different positions. Flame throwers were tested on humans. Humans were tied to sticks and rods and used as targets to test germ-releasing bombs, chemical weapons, and explosive bombs. Prisoners were injected with inoculations of disease, disguised as vaccinations, to study their effects. To study the effects of untreated venereal diseases, male and female prisoners were deliberately infected with syphilis and gonorrhea, then studied. Prisoners were infested with fleas to acquire large quantities of disease-carrying fleas to study the viability of germ warfare. Plague fleas, infected clothing, and infected supplies encased in bombs were dropped on various targets. The resulting cholera, anthrax, and plague were estimated to have killed around 400,000 Chinese civilians. Tularemia was tested on Chinese civilians. The Togo Unit employed gruesome tactics to secure specimens of select body organs. If Ishii or one of his co-workers wished to do research on the human brain, then they would order the guards to find them a useful sample. A prisoner would be taken from his cell. Guards would hold him while another guard would smash the victim\u2019s head open with an ax. His brain would be extracted off to the pathologist, and then to the crematorium for the usual disposal. Some of the experiments had nothing to do with advancing the capability of germ warfare, or of medicine. There is such a thing as professional curiosity: \u2018What would happen if we did such and such?\u2019 What medical purpose was served by performing and studying beheadings? None at all.

In a number of separate experiments it was then determined how these parameters depend on the time of day a victim\u2019s body part was immersed in freezing water, the surrounding temperature and humidity during immersion, how the victim had been treated before the immersion (\u201cafter keeping awake for a night\u201d, \u201cafter hunger for 24 hours\u201d, \u201cafter hunger for 48 hours\u201d, \u201cimmediately after heavy meal\u201d, \u201cimmediately after hot meal\u201d, \u201cimmediately after muscular exercise\u201d, \u201cimmediately after cold bath\u201d, \u201cimmediately after hot bath\u201d), what type of food the victim had been fed over the five days preceding the immersions with regard to dietary nutrient intake (\u201chigh protein (of animal nature)\u201d, \u201chigh protein (of vegetable nature)\u201d, \u201clow protein intake\u201d, and \u201cstandard diet\u201d), and salt intake (45 g NaCl per day, 15 g NaCl per day, no salt).( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-65) Infection of venereal disease by injection was abandoned, and the researchers started forcing the prisoners into sexual acts with each other. Four or five unit members, dressed in white laboratory clothing completely covering the body with only eyes and mouth visible, rest covered, handled the tests. A male and female, one infected with syphilis, would be brought together in a cell and forced into sex with each other. It was made clear that anyone resisting would be shot.( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-66) After victims were infected, they were vivisected at different stages of infection, so that internal and external organs could be observed as the disease progressed. Testimony from multiple guards blames the female victims as being hosts of the diseases, even as they were forcibly infected. Genitals of female prisoners that were infected with syphilis were called \u201cjam-filled buns\u201d by guards.( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731#cite_note-gold-testimony-67) Female prisoners were forced to become pregnant for use in experiments. The hypothetical possibility of vertical transmission (from mother to child) of diseases, particularly syphilis, was the stated reason for the torture.

Vivisections were conducted on detainees after infecting them with various diseases. Scientists performed invasive surgery on prisoners, removing organs to study the effects of disease on the human body. The experiments were conducted while the patients were alive because it was feared that the decomposition process would affect the results. Human targets were used to test grenades positioned at various distances and in different positions. Flame throwers were tested on humans. Humans were tied to sticks and rods and used as targets to test germ-releasing bombs, chemical weapons, and explosive bombs. Prisoners were injected with inoculations of disease, disguised as vaccinations, to study their effects. To study the effects of untreated venereal diseases, male and female prisoners were deliberately infected with syphilis and gonorrhea, then studied. Prisoners were infested with fleas to acquire large quantities of disease-carrying fleas to study the viability of germ warfare. Plague fleas, infected clothing, and infected supplies encased in bombs were dropped on various targets. The resulting cholera, anthrax, and plague were estimated to have killed around 400,000 Chinese civilians. Tularemia was tested on Chinese civilians. The Togo Unit employed gruesome tactics to secure specimens of select body organs. If Ishii or one of his co-workers wished to do research on the human brain, then they would order the guards to find them a useful sample. A prisoner would be taken from his cell. Guards would hold him while another guard would smash the victim\u2019s head open with an ax. His brain would be extracted off to the pathologist, and then to the crematorium for the usual disposal. Some of the experiments had nothing to do with advancing the capability of germ warfare, or of medicine.

When this happens, it bursts out across the flat North_China_Plain sometimes taking a new channel and inundating most farmland, cities or towns in its path. The traditional Chinese response of building higher and higher Leveealong the banks sometimes also contributed to the severity of the floods: When flood water did break through the levees, it could no longer drain back into the river bed as it would after a normal flood, as the river bed was sometimes now higher than the surrounding countryside. These changes could cause the river\u2019s mouth to shift as much as 480 km (300 mi sometimes reaching the ocean to the north of ShandongPeninsula and sometimes to the south.
