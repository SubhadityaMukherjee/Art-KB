Sekhmet was a leonine deity usually depicted as a woman with the head of a lion. Her name means &ldquo;Powerful&rdquo; and is usually interpreted as &ldquo;The Female Powerful One&rdquo;. She was a goddess of destruction and healing, of desert winds and cool breezes. She was the daughter of Ra who appears in one of the most important stories concerning the Eye of Ra/Distant Goddess motif. When Ra became tired of the sins of humanity, he sent Sekhmet to destroy them. She ravaged the land until the other gods implored Ra to stop her before humans were destroyed completely. Ra had a vat of beer dyed red to attract Sekhmet&rsquo;s blood lust and left it at Dendera where she drank it and fell into a deep sleep; when she woke she was the benevolent Hathor. Sekhmet continued to exist in her leonine form, however, and was the patron deity of the military for her powers of destruction and vengeance. She was known as &ldquo;Smiter of the Nubians&rdquo; in this regard but she also brought natural disaster. Plagues were known as &ldquo;Messengers of Sekhmet&rdquo; or &ldquo;Slaughterers of Sekhmet&rdquo;. In the same way that she could bring the desert winds, she could deflect them, and the same with pestilence; just as she had brought the plague, she could cure it and was known as &ldquo;Mistress of Life&rdquo; in this capacity (and so was frequently invoked in healing spells and incantations by ancient doctors). She was closely associated with other leonine deities such as Bastet and Pakhet and was thought to be the aggressive, violent aspect of the goddess Mut.</li> </ul> <br> <div class="row wm-article-nav-buttons" role=navigation aria-label=navigation> <div class="wm-article-nav pull-right"> <a href=../Selene%20%28Roman%20name%20Luna%29/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-right"> Next <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden=true></i> </a> <a href=../Selene%20%28Roman%20name%20Luna%29/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Selene (Roman name Luna) </a> </div> <div class=wm-article-nav> <a href=../Segoyong/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-left"> <i class="fa fa-chevron-left" aria-hidden=true></i> Previous</a><a href=../Segoyong/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Segoyong </a> </div> </div> <br> </div> <footer class="container-fluid wm-page-content"> <p>Documentation built with <a href=https://www.mkdocs.org/ >MkDocs</a> using <a href=https://github.com/gristlabs/mkdocs-windmill>Windmill</a> theme by Grist Labs.</p> </footer> </body> </html>
