He was represented by a paper image made by the most prestigious woman of the household and was kept in the same place throughout the year. Zao-Shen was responsible for the happiness of the home and the prosperity of the family, but this depended on their behavior and values. Every month Zao-Shen left the home to report to the local gods and spirits on the family&rsquo;s conduct. If they had behaved well, he was instructed to increase their riches and happiness; if they had behaved badly, he was told to withdraw riches and happiness. &ldquo;Riches&rdquo; meant not only material wealth but comfort and well-being, which was further assured by his warding off evil spirits.</li> <li>When he left the home to make his report, families were especially anxious because they had no household protector. At the end of the lunar year, on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, Zao-Shen had to leave to report to <a href=Shangti.md.md>Shangti</a> himself and the universal gods on how the family had behaved throughout the year. At this time, more incense was burned than usual in front of the paper statue and its mouth was smeared with honey so that only sweet words about the family would be reported to the gods. Offerings of fine foods and good wine were placed before him to thank him for his protection. The paper figure was then burned and firecrackers set off to speed him on his way. The next morning, the first day of the New Year, a new paper statue was made and placed above the stove.</li> </ul> <br> <div class="row wm-article-nav-buttons" role=navigation aria-label=navigation> <div class="wm-article-nav pull-right"> <a href=../Zelus%20%28aka%20Zelos%29/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-right"> Next <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden=true></i> </a> <a href=../Zelus%20%28aka%20Zelos%29/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Zelus (aka Zelos) </a> </div> <div class=wm-article-nav> <a href=../Za%27atar/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-left"> <i class="fa fa-chevron-left" aria-hidden=true></i> Previous</a><a href=../Za%27atar/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Za'atar </a> </div> </div> <br> </div> <footer class="container-fluid wm-page-content"> <p>Documentation built with <a href=https://www.mkdocs.org/ >MkDocs</a> using <a href=https://github.com/gristlabs/mkdocs-windmill>Windmill</a> theme by Grist Labs.</p> </footer> </body> </html>
