The sedimentation causes natural dams to slowly accumulate. These subaqueous dams are unpredictable and generally undetectable. Eventually, the enormous amount of water needs to find a new way to the sea, forcing it to take the Path_of_least_resistance). When this happens, it bursts out across the flat North_China_Plain sometimes taking a new channel and inundating most farmland, cities or towns in its path. The traditional Chinese response of building higher and higher Leveealong the banks sometimes also contributed to the severity of the floods: When flood water did break through the levees, it could no longer drain back into the river bed as it would after a normal flood, as the river bed was sometimes now higher than the surrounding countryside. These changes could cause the river&rsquo;s mouth to shift as much as 480 km (300 mi sometimes reaching the ocean to the north of ShandongPeninsula and sometimes to the south.

In AD 923, the desperate Later_Liang_(Five_Dynasties)general Duan_Ningagain broke the dikes, flooding 1,000 square miles (2,600 km2in a failed attempt to protect his realm&rsquo;s capital from the Later_Tang). A similar proposal from the Southern_Songengineer Li Chun concerning flooding the lower reaches of the river to protect the central plains from the Liao_dynastywas overruled in 1020: the Chanyuan_Treatybetween the two states had expressly forbidden the Song from establishing new moats or changing river courses.Yellow_River -Sedtime-22)</li> <li>On 9 June 1938, during the Second_Sino-Japanese_War Kuomintangtroops under Chiang_Kai-shek)1938_Yellow_River_floodholding back the river near the village of Huayuankou,_Henanin Henan, causing what has been called by Canadian historian, Diana Lary, a &ldquo;war-induced natural disaster&rdquo;.

The 1938_Yellow_River_floodof an area covering 54,000 km2 (20,800 sq mitook some 500,000 to 900,000 Chinese lives, along with an unknown number of Japanese soldiers. The flood prevented the Japanese Army from taking Zhengzhou on the southern bank of the Yellow River, but did not stop them from reaching their goal of capturing Wuhan which was the temporary seat of the Chinese government and straddles the Yangtze_River).Yellow_River -31)</li> </ul> <br> <div class="row wm-article-nav-buttons" role=navigation aria-label=navigation> <div class="wm-article-nav pull-right"> <a href=../Yi%20Ke%20Yin/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-right"> Next <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden=true></i> </a> <a href=../Yi%20Ke%20Yin/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> Yi Ke Yin </a> </div> <div class=wm-article-nav> <a href=../Yellow%20Mustard%20Seeds/ class="btn btn-xs btn-default pull-left"> <i class="fa fa-chevron-left" aria-hidden=true></i> Previous</a><a href=../Yellow%20Mustard%20Seeds/ class="btn btn-xs btn-link"> docs/Yellow Mustard Seeds </a> </div> </div> <br> </div> <footer class="container-fluid wm-page-content"> <p>Documentation built with <a href=https://www.mkdocs.org/ >MkDocs</a> using <a href=https://github.com/gristlabs/mkdocs-windmill>Windmill</a> theme by Grist Labs.</p> </footer> </body> </html>
